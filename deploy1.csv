The OVO Hydro,"We have a nice experience here in Glasogw, staff where friendly The OVO hydro sometimes has big queues to get in, and inside. The staff are quite good at directing you to your seat. There are plenty of toilets, the women’s toilet usually has a queue but it goes in fairly quick compared to other places. Most seats have a decent view except the extreme right and left. Good train links but poor car park because if you park there it’d take a long time to get out. Good number of hotels around about. The OVO is an excellent venue and maintains our position as an international events city. In terms of accessibility I often feel signage could be clearer and there could be more bathroom option.Pricing is very expensive and not always suitable for a family day/evening out. The acoustics are good, even from the higher tiered seating. Transport links could be slightly better. Very often have a long wait or journey home after an event. Overall good venue and glad we have it in Glasgow.  I was there for a concert in November 2022 and the staff were very friendly. In my case I am visually impaired and they helped me to move and find my seats. I will be back in the future of course I would say this venue was okay but very busy and two crowded to move  Very confusing system; The OVO Hydro Paramore gig. Apart from the pavements around the hydro this is a great venue. We have found a parking spot that allows us to make use of all the drop kerbs around the venue. We drive to the venue as the local subway isn’t accessible. We park round near the science centre and then roll over to the venue which is under a 10 minute roll. The accessible seating area on the ground floor gives a good view of the stage as you are up above everyone standings heads and the bar is low enough on the platform that it doesn’t obscure the view    The OVO Hydro Paolo Nutini. Paolo Nutini concert Got a taxi there and back. Takes ages to get in and out with a car. Taxi best way to do it. Straight in through specific entrance and ramp to space and chair for friend. Great view. Need Changing Places Toilet Really friendly and really helpful.  The OVO Hydro going to a concert. I have been to a lot of great concerts over the years in Ovo Hydro and it  has quite good disabled access usually I get drop off when going to  a concert but the last time I was there we took the car but we got parked easily in the big car park  where has a lot of disabled bays. outside the  place is all  smooth and fair and doors are nice and wide.  once you get outside inside it is very big to get around  and there is a big fix but there is 1 lift there  could be another lift.  there is disabled sitting upstairs and downstairs where you can get a great view but when you   there is a changing places  upstairs and there is a lot of disabled toilets which are  quite big   The OVO Hydro Reviewing from seats in Block 056. Visited the SSE Hydro to see The 1975 as a birthday treat and had a fantastic time! From booking tickets to actually accessing the show, everything was so smooth. I was dropped off in a car at the front door.
I believe this is also where taxis can come too and public transport. I did have to roll on the road to get onto a kerb so more drop-kerbs would be preferred. If you’re coming to park there is a parking garage almost next door which charges. I entered via the accessibility lane at door A and then had to roll round the entire arena to get to my door (D) for block 056. This was my mistake but I did just want out the rain asap! When inside everything is signposted clearly and if you’re in early this is a good time to look around at the mer I used the accessible toilet which is at the top of the ramp to 056. It was big enough for myself and a carer. RADAR key is required to get in - every staff member has one on their belt. The red cord touches the floor and handrails are on both sides. So helpful! Everyone from the outside security, merch vendors and stewards inside were so cheerful and happy to help without being condescending. If you require wheelchair accessible seating phone up the SSE booking line and they can also issue a companion/carer ticket for free if needed. The OVO Hydro My Experience. The toileting facilities were exquisite.      The OVO Hydro A great place for a gig. Despite having to hit redial for 2 hours to get tickets (unless you are luckier than me and get through quicker), the venue is super accessible and if you manage to get tickets for the accessible area just higher than ground level,you feel part of the crowd. The accessible s There is parking at the venue though this costs £10, if you can, you can find on street parking. Level access and lifts to all accessible floors. Spacious accessible toilets using the Radar key. Super helpful, very friendly  The OVO Hydro Madness concert. Lots of parking but have to.pay. Security let you in a separate door from crowd and a little earlier. Lift to level.for.seats. All on the flat then. Security put us in space and sear for friend. Good view..Bar at a good height level. All in all was treated well and had good seats Lots of disabled spaces but have to pay and ground underfoot can be a bit rough. All flat and lift from NCP. Doors all open and security to.help. N/A Helpful Attentive Bit friendly CEA card gets carer in for free. The OVO Hydro Accessible but..No stairs to the entry of building which is good and also had lifts if needed to go upstairs. However, it is very busy and the parking is not the best so you may need to walk a bit and also stand for a while. I walked but the nearest car park was extremely busy and the traffic was really bad.  Pretty easy to find as signs are around and if you can’t see the signs, there are lots of staff walking around that you could ask.   The OVO Hydro James Taylor. This visit to The SSE Hydro was our umpteenth and I really only have one minor complaint. That is the parking. It costs £10 and escaping from the car park is a nightmare.      The OVO Hydro Great for wheelchair users. I was really happy with the accessibility and there were lots of staff on hand to help if needed. Well signposted. No issues getting to the area, I don't think the seats were very comfy for my sister so if you have pain problems and aren't in a wheelchair I wouldn't recom  There is a lift right in the centre, it’s all pretty flat. The ground is flat and the venue is huge and easy to manoeuvre. If you’re in the lower half there is a toilet very close to the platform which is great, and its not too far upstairs. There are a lot of accessible toilets and there are changing places toilets on both levels. All toilets are clean and accessed by radar key, they are all big and modern. There are always a lot of staff on hand to help, they are always polite and friendly This is the best venue I’ve been to for gigs as a wheelchair user, I go about 5-8 times a year and can’t fault it The OVO Hydro The SSE Hydro, SEC, Glasgow. Really nice & helpful staff! Great toilets, terrible food! I drove my mobility scooter from my hotel to the SSE Hydro so I can't comment on the parking but the path from my hotel to the SSE Hydro was terrible,  loads of cobblestones and kerbs with no way to get down. Very accessible. Lots of seats. Great view, have been in the tiered seating and the wheelchair spaces on ground level and have never had a problem! To get to the disabled toilet, you need to ask the steward who opens the door for you. When you're in the toilet, it is very spacious and I could easily turn my mobility scooter! Absolutely brilliant!  The OVO Hydro Disabled patrons not allowed to use drop-off and pick-up  outside Armadillo and Hydro.Disabled patrons will no longer be able to use the drop-off and pick-up points outside the Armadillo and Hydro. All patrons including disabled have to use the SEC car park (30mins).  I am assured that a new system       The OVO Hydro Great venue - been many times!. I've been many times to The SSE Hydro and always had a good experience, which makes this one of my favourite venues in terms of accessibility as a powered wheelchair user. I've never parked in the multi storey parking so can't comment on the venues parking. I always park on Minerva St/Minerva Way near the exhibition centre train station and walk through the tunnel. Disabled access is very good at the Hydro. Level-entry access into the venue with lifts within to take you to the different levels. Anytime I've never the lifts have always been quiet - never had to queue. Staff friendly and helpful. Viewing platform the accessible seating is also very good. I somet There are accessible toilets on ground level and Level 2. There is also a changing places toilet in the West lobby of Level 2. All accessible toilets are operated by a radar key, which can be issued by a steward or purchased from the Information Desk if you don’t have your own. 

Generally the toi The staff have always been very helpful and friendly. On many occasions I've had staff approach me to ask if I need any assistance and to make sure I know where I'm going. Not had any bad experiences with the staff. The only downside is the process of booking accessible tickets for events in high demand, which can be impossible.  Accessible tickets are booked online and when it's a high demand show then you can be on hold for a very long time. I would love there to be an easier process for booking accessible ti The OVO Hydro Great if you like watching bands from a distance.The wheelchair spots are far away from the stage, but a quick look over your shoulder will reveal other paying patrons much further away.  They don't seem to mind but that's their business - I'm stuck in those poor spots.

This is based on two rock       The OVO Hydro The sse Hydro. Been here a few times every time had an excellent experience. Plenty of staff around and willing to help.      The OVO Hydro Chaos in picking up disabled patrons outside the Hydro. Great facilities inside Hydro and multistorey good but takes ages to get out.  Main problem is if the disabled person is being dropped off outside the Hydro and picked  again.  This was a particularly busy event and when pick up the disabled pa      The OVO Hydro Not great. A lot of issues. This was my first visit to the SSE Hydro (to see Madonna) and I will admit I was disappointed with a number of things. For a modern venue I expected disabled patrons needs to be incorparated into the venue, not catered for to what seemed to me, a mere afterthought.
I hav Plenty parking in nearby multistorey but walkway to Hydro is a bit of a walk, lift then walk. All exposed to elements. Cost £8 which I expected.
Would be better if had blue badge parking directly outside but doesnt.
Took 30 mins to get car out of multistorey due to high volume of cars leaving. Yes, there were disabled toilets but why should that be all we should expect? Disabled seats on 2nd level were a let down. Uncomfortable and limited view if you can only remain seated (at gigs..other events people in front may remain seated?)
Take a cushion with you if you have comfort issues Although there was signage they were still difficult to locate. Not as many accessible toilets as expected. You will need radar key or help unlocking from staff. I am able to use regular toilets. Bit inconvienient that ladies are only at each end..plenty of mens toilets scattered throughout venue plenty of them. Some were not over enthuisatic towards disabled. Saw me struggling but didnt advise how far left to walk. Inside staff were helpful to the point of irritating. Kept telling people in front of me to sit down so I could see. I was very embarrased after 3 times. Would not hurry back. Modern does not mean it is more disabled friendly alas. 
Plan your trip wisely especially if you get breathless or uncomfortable as i do. 
Could have been somuch better The OVO Hydro Great venue, great gig!. Great staff, great venue, great accessible seating, great view, great set up for food & drink... Only downside is the parking. Why oh why can't there be some Blue Badge parking nearer the front door? There is lots of space. We were lucky in that there were a group of us so we got dropped off at the entrance and one of us then went to park the car. I'm not sure what the public transport links are like nearby but there are lo Access is great! Step free access from front door to seats. We were on the accessible seating platform accessed from Door A. There was a short ramp to get to this. The platform itself has both moveable and fixed seating which made organising ourselves very easy. View from accessible seating area bri There is an accessible loo at the top of the ramp but we didn't use it. Looked to be good size. Again - amazing! From helping us find our way to helping organise the seating on the platform they were just great. Great gig venue. Will definitely come back and see more bands here! The OVO Hydro access Review. The  venue is very wheelchair friendly  and has easy access  to the high raised wheelchair area  with a great view with a ramp to the viewing area. The multi-storey car park has several disabled parking bays on the second level.  It is £8 to use the car parking facility for disabled parking swell as normal parking. Well laid out for disabled customers.  Staff are good and friendly.  The OVO Hydro Fantastic wheelchair access inside and out. Car park just across the road with a walkway and lift. Flat entrance into hydro, lift to floor with accessible seats. Good view from accessible seating, although this might be different if at a concert with the people in front standing. Car Park across the road, covered walkway to venue and lifts to get to ground floor. No lips to get wheelchair over, entrance is flush with pavement. Good size lift to floor where accessible seats are. Accessible toilet a good size for wheelchair and carer, entrance to toilet with radar key, staff on hand if you don't have one. Toilet very clean. Staff very helpful, holding doors, etc. Great venue, seems a lot of effort has been made to make accessible for wheelchair users. The OVO Hydro Horrendous. Just back from the Hydro. This venue is huge, therefore, anyone with mobility issues will really struggle. Despite numerous food outlets, there are no seats at all where people can sit and eat. I spoke with a couple both of whom have MS, like myself. They sat on the stairs but were moved Huge distance from the car park to the venue. Walkway doesn't go directly into the Hydro but requires circumnavigation of outside of building. For disabled people who are not using a wheelchair, of which there are many, thIs venue is very challenging. Radar key required but staff on hand and very helpful. Doors are heavy and difficult to manage independently. Thankfully, all the staff are helpful and friendly. No information on the website about disabled access. The OVO Hydro The Hydro. Multiple areas provide choice for wheelchair areas. CG 2014 venues have no on-site parking. However for general use distance is perhaps challenging. Good design with excellent staff support Was not able to view on the day Staff on the day knowledgeable (Previous two visits found staff superb) Upper Wheelchair spaces, sightlines affected by people standing up in the front row. The OVO Hydro A WOW! space. Fantastic arena, really good and very spacious. Parking in nearby car park Very accessible. Lots of seats. Great views. Might be different if people in front stand up. Lots of space and easy to get in. Spacious. Very helpful and nice. Maybe lower glass in the viewing area? A fantastic arena! The OVO Hydro What a great space !. Good access, great venue and fantastic views of the performance area. Blue Badge parking is available in the adjacent car park. Vehicles can drop off out side the main door. There's also an accessible bus service that runs into town. The Exhibition railway station is a short distance away if travelling by train. Access into the building was good with wide doors and level surfaces. Once inside a lift takes you up to the wheelchair seating area. The view were fantastic and instead of the usual high wall between you as a wheelchair user and the view there's a glass wall. It felt much more comfortable and you c Disappointed to have to move a chair out of the way  that was blocking the doorway to the accessible loo I visited. The toilet was accessed using a RADAR key. It was not particualrly spacious and could be difficult if you had a carer. It wasn't the cleanest of loos I'd seen either. Staff were helpful and enthusiastic. Helped us to take some groups photos. Defintely one of the best venues to go and watch a performance or event. Let down by confusing signage and lack of attention to details like keep the accessible loos clear of obstruction. The OVO Hydro Roaming around the Hydro. Markings weren't quite clear enough in the building which actually resulted in the staff member (that was giving us a tour) getting lost! I was dropped off at the entrance so unsure of parking provision. It seemed that the entrance at the side of the Hydro is used for level access (this is certainly the entrance we were asked to use). If so, again there was no signage advising of this but once inside it was spacious enough and the lifts were big enough for at least 2 wheelchairs which is a bonus. I didn't visit the toilets so unsure of the access rating for them. The staff members who took us around were pleasant enough but probably wouldn't be the people assisting wheelchair users to their spaces on a daily bases as they were often confused where the wheelchair sections on each stand were. We found it quite confusing to find our way around and this was a time when the building was empty. I can only imagine it will be even more difficult when the venue is packed. However, there will be more staff on  hand then to assist with queries etc which should help to solve that problem. The OVO Hydro The SSE Hydro Glasgow. Overall access from the car park area to the seating is first class Very Close to the venue, brilliant Excellent Clinically clean and very easy to access Staff incredible. The Hydro has obviously considered disabled access during the design and construction phase of the design. The result is amazing for disabled guests."
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall,"Lovely building, good staff, expensive drinks. Unable to access the halls independently as stairs aren't easily identifiable. The edge of the  stairs is not easily seen start and finish at they are all same. I was there for the Celtic Connection. Staff helped us a lot. The most accessible entrance is the door which is in form of Ask Italian. Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Friendly staff in the ticket centre. Seeing friendly staff in the ticket centre. Staff are all relatives. My cousin is the box office manger. Communications is great. I got the bus Difficult to access as there are loads of stairs. There was a lift a ramp and good signage. Toilets are spotless. Staff are good at giving directions. We had a seating plan and user friendly. Great venue for people with learning disabilities and visual impairments and physical disabilities Glasgow Royal Concert Hall I love going to see Nathan Carter at concert hall. I like the concert hall for a concert you get great view of everything there is inside car park near by and a lot of buses goes by. also you  go across to the bus station for the taxi bit even although there's a lot of stairs there is few   lifts.  the disabled sitting areas  is down front at sides of the stage where you have fantastic view 

when Nathan Carter is playing he comes out after the show to meet everyone so there is a line for wheelchair users no changing places toilet staff is nice and very helpful  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Adam and the Ants. Adam and the Ants concert Parked in NCP across the road Pavement at front has no dropped kerb,so bit of bump to get up. Doors already open. Small wheelchair lifts to main foyer. Straight through and up another lift to our level. Disabled area gave us a great view. Did not try Very efficient and helpful  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Brilliant Staff. We went to see the RSNO who were brilliant but the staff made the night.
I use a sporty scarlet rollator to get about short distances. One entering the Concert Hall and thinking about the stairs one of the staff directed me to a wee lift which took my husband and I up to the main f   The loo I was guided to was across the other side of the theatre and hidden in the corner. I'm glad I didn't use a wheelchair as it would have been a tight squeeze. Unfailingly helpful, cheerful and polite. They are why we are going back.  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Royal Concert Hall Glasgow. Fairly easy to get to by public transport (opposite Buchanan Bus Station) Very close to Buchanan Bus Station, also car parking close by, but it closes before some concerts finish! Train stations are a bit far away. One entry is wheelchair friendly but not the one at the top of Buchanan Street (behind Donald Dewar statue) Two disabled toilets in main venue, others are available on the premises. Vacant/engaged signs could be clearer. Some are very helpful but others could do with more disability awareness training.  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Celtic connections for the Brave. This is an accessible venue, with lift access and designated wheelchair accessible areas. Unfortunately the restricted viewing at the accessible area was quite extreme. Fantastic staff who remedied it quickly, but it made us a bit of a spectical which left the kids  Parking is available in the Buchanan Galleries car park (fee attached), but we were lucky enough to find on street parking (free with blue badge). 

The venue is in the centre of Glasgow, so plenty of transport links. Buchanan bus station is directly opposite the disabled access entrance. The disabled access entrance is available on Killermont Street. There are two platform lifts giving access (from either side of the staircase in the entrance hall). 

Once inside the main area of the concert hall, there is various entrance points for disabled access, depending on where you are to  The accessible toilets are hidden slightly and were a little difficult to find. This could be because it was such a busy event, so it may well be easier to find when the venue is quieter. 

The looks themselves were quite tight and cramped. Far from the spacious changing places loos. The staff were incredibly helpful throughout. They helped make it such an amazing experience, despite the problems we had at that beginning. The seats we were allocated at the side of the venue were very poor (you will see in the images). If the event takes place on the stage, it might not be too much of an issue. However, if you’re watching something on the big screen, then it is incredibly poor. 

As I mentioned above though, the sta Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Wheelchair Seating. First of all I would like to thank Euan's Guide for arranging the tickets for this Celtic Connections showing of BRAVE in Concert with the Live music of the Scottish National Orchestra at the Royal Concert Hall.
The show/film was brilliant but the only thing that was wrong was t There was no specific parking at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall so we parked the car about half a mile away from the venue and we pushed along the road to the venue. The access was good using the small wheelchair lifts at either side of the stairs. I did not get to use the toilets.
There was accessible toilets, but they were not on the level of the seating, you had to go and use the lifts and go down a level which took time as the wheelchair lifts were slow and you would miss about 10-15 minutes of the show depending on how agile you are. The staff were great when we got to the seating area, then helping us with our wheelchairs when we had to transfer to the seats, they then put our wheelchairs away and then returned them as soon as the show was over. Watching the film on the big screen and the music from the SNO was great as this was the first time I have been in a theatre / cinema in all the years I have been disabled (36 years).
I would go again if the wheelchair seating was improved.
Sorry I did not take any pictures. Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Celtic Connections Brave in Concert. This is a fantastic family day out! I love the film Brave and to see the music played by a live orchestra was incredible! 

The Royal Concert Hall is a great venue. The accessibile entrance is at the side of the building and has an automatic door. You then use  On the particular day of travel there was disruption on the railway which made my journey more difficult. Always check before you travel.

One beside the cafe which tends to be used by everyone. The second one is beside the cloakroom at the bottom of the main foyer. The first entrance to these toilets is unmarked. It is at the end of a long corridor beside other male and female toilets Staff are very friendly and helpful and always around the venue to ask for help I really enjoyed this visit and the Concert was incredible the only thing that let it down was the restriction in viewing at the accessibile seating Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Celtic Connections- Roaming Roots. Entering from the side across the road from the bus station, there is a small lift to take you to the first level. There are plenty of staff members to guide you to where you need to be. Another lit takes you to the concert hall level. There is a bar here too. Goin Right next to the bus station and plenty parking. Fully accessible with well thought through lifts and a brilliant wheelchair viewing platform. The accessible toilets are a lift journey away couple with fighting through the crowd of people in the hallway. One toilet is quite petite but the other has more space . The staff could not have been more friendly, particularly at the viewing platform.  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Praise gathering concert. I have used the wheelchair spaces here a few times and although not ideal because of layout and position in the auditorium it’s better than nothing. Although on this occasion I was angry at being charged £18 for a ticket to find that my view was blocked by 2 cameras filming No disabled parking but there are car parks local that have lots of disabled spaces esp the Buchanan galleries Access not great the lift from ground to main level requires the door to be closed by a helper if you are on your own there is no one there to assist. Disabled toilet is on main floor. Disabled seating in 2 floors up. The lift can only take one wheelchair and maybe 2 slim people at a time. I have been late back to the performance because I couldn’t get an empty lift Staff vary from very helpful to being trained by the SAS. Last time there one woman trying to clear the lift was pulling at my wheelchair to get me to come out so she could get me to the toilet she wanted me to go too. Thankfully the door closed before my carer said something she would regret Not sure I’ll go back to be honest. There was always something to spoil my night but not enough to stop me going not till this time. They really need staff development on customer care never mind providing proper disabled access Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Great view of the stage but totally thoughtless. The wheelchair area offers a great view of the stage. BUT the venue have crammed four wheelchair spaces into the allocated space and companions have to sit behind the wheelchair users crammed against the wall. As previous reviewers stated, this means  We drove and parked at the concert car park across from the venue. Quite difficult to find the disabled spaces within the car park but once we did it was great and handy for the concert hall Wheelchair access to the venue is via Killermont Street. You have to get two separate  lifts to get to the main concert hall. The second one was not well sign posted and quite a distance away but there were lots of ushers on hand to direct us and impressed that there was a dedicated usher in the sec Really poorly sign posted. We had to ask several people before we found the disabled loos tucked overly discretely behind a screen in the cafe area. The toilet we used was very tight for a wheelchair user and companion. There were grab rails and an alarm. However the door lock and paper towel dispen Staff were helpful when asked for anything but didn’t volunteer assistance. The steward nearest our viewing area hasn’t worked there before but even he was shocked that the space was so tight.  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Were We in the Way??. Have been to the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow many times and had lots of good visits. This particular visit stood out for the wrong reasons - but hopefully is a one-off. (Rating is for this visit only)

Good variety of music and concerts, for people of all ages and interests No parking immediately at the venue itself, but has a multi-storey across the road. This has marked disabled bays on the ground floor. 
There is a height restriction to use this. 

There can be parking in the nearby streets, depends on your luck, it is a city centre venue.

It is close to Queen Using wheelchairs, it is necessary to use the North entrance on Killamont Street, which has street-level doors. The South entrance is via a big set of stairs only.

Inside the North entrance, there is a small set of stairs (about 4) but they have a small individual lift to go up these. This is to  There are accessible toilets throughout the building, but we didn't use them This was hard to score, as some of the staff were great, and I've also had good experiences previously.

However, for this particular visit, I wouldn't truthfully be able to give a high score.  Although I can understand the member of staff was anxious about the smooth-running of the performance, I This is generally a great venue, with a wide variety of music and events.
It has lots of positive accessibility facilities within the building.
It could be made even better with some disability awareness training for staff. Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Royal Concert Hall. Though it might be slightly difficult to get there, there is easier access within the building including the cafe and auditoriums. Friendly and approachable staff.  Overall, a good experience for a night out at the Royal Concert Hall! Car park is shared with Buchanan Galleries (Shopping Centre). (2 -3 minute walk outside)
Located 5 minutes walk away from Queen Street station. Central station is about 10 - 15 minutes walk away. However, both station would require an uphill journey to the venue. 
Buchanan bus station is located a Clear signage around the building, ramps and lifts available to all levels in the foyer and the auditorium. Wide aisles for movement around the building. There are 2 public entrances. However, only one of them can be used for disabled access. (Killermont Street) There are accessible toilets in the building. However, it is located at the back, near the cafe which might not be easily located. Space within the toilet was sufficient for moving around. A lot of staff available within the building. Eg. At the Cafe, Gift shop and the Box office. Staff seemed friendly and approachable. Overall, a positive experience and a great venue for concerts. Glasgow Royal Concert Hall No space to swing a cat.

The overall access to the venue is very good, in that there are lifts to all levels and there are no steps if you follow the disabled signs. One criticism of the venue is that we went as a family and only my carer was able to sit with me. She was  There's only street parking or multistory car parking, which can be a problem if you have a large wheelchair accessible vehicle. Easily accessible into the main hall. This venue does have accessible toilets, but I didn't use them. The member of staff on the disabled seating floor was a bit snippy with my PA when she pulled her seat forward to be beside me, but apologised afterwards when we were coming out. My criticisms did not spoil my enjoyment of the concert."
Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome,"Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Sports Centre in Glasgow's EastEnd. Lovely Sports Centre in Glasgow Plenty of Disabled Parking if needed near the venue. Nextbike Hire Bike Docking Station at the centre with plenty of space for personal bikes also. Easy to access the venue with automatic doors with push button to access. Accessible toilets on the ground floor near the lift. Friendly Staff at Reception and Cafe area.  Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome LETS GO ROCKS!!. My first time at the Emirates arena to watch Glasgow Rocks vs. Newcastle Eagles and it was a great day, from start to finish we had a fantastic day. The staff were amazing and very informative. I will definitely be going back in the future. Also the views are fantastic. Plenty of disabled spaces, seemed a good, large carpark with room around each parking bay. There are automatic doors and then level access into the cafe and a few accessible toilets. Outside, there is a lift for wheelchair users. From the lift, you go to level 3, and it is then level access. In the arena there are many wheelchair spaces all on the same level as the entrance. They each hav I only used the toilets beside the café and they were good but I accidently hit the red cord and staff came running in, ""hey guys?"". Nice and spacious toilets. Staff are tremendous but you wont need them for much because the emerites arena is fantastic. I would seriously recommend attending because I had an amazing day and if I had a amazing day then you should all have an amazing, happy DAYY!! Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Great accessible night watching Glasgow Rocks basketball. First time both at the Emirates Arena and to a basketball game, so it was great to combine them both for a great experience. I had absolutely no problems at all with accessibility throughout the arena and it was fun from beginning to end.  I  There are lots of accessible parking spaces, but as I attended close to the start time there were no accessible spaces left. It wasn't a problem though as the steward advised us to park in the adjacent section which was still pretty close to the entrance. As you approach the main entrance it's important to remember that there is an external lift to take you to the main arena. The lift is on the left-hand side outside - there is a yellow sign indicating where the lift is, but it is up quite high so it may not be completely noticeable straight away. Th There were several accessible toilets throughout the arena both near the viewing area and in the main foyer. The one I saw looked spacious and clean. Enough space for a wheelchair and a companion.
The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is due to there being no changing places toilet. I didn't speak to any staff, but they all seemed very friendly. Had a really enjoyable first experience of a basketball game and found the accessibility of the Emirates Arena to be very good. I would definitely return and recommend to others.

We visited the Emirates Arena to watch a Basketball game - we went to cafe and main arena, can't comment on other areas. If travelling by car, large area of carpark with disabled parking bays. Seemed good layout with room around each parking bay.

Although it was busy for the event when we were there, there were staff directing the traffic as it arrived/left. This was well organised, it did take a bit of time for ev We went to the cafe first which is on the ground floor. There are automatic doors and then level access. Next to the cafe are male/female/accessible toilets.

There is a lift to go to the main arena - we didnt realise at first that the lift is outside, beside the stairs. So if in the cafe, you nee There are lots of accessible toilets in the building, there are many around the arena.

All that I saw were roomy enough to have a wheelchair and carer in, if required.
Baby changing facilities were not sharing this space.

I noticed in several of them though, the emergency pull-cords were tuck Didn't speak to staff all that much, but were helpful when asked them for directions to lift, finding our seats etc. We enjoyed our day. Family friendly, and with different entertainment going on as well as the game itself. 
We particularly liked seeing the Basketball Acrobatics team. Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Glasgow Rocks Basketball with a friend. Great night at the basketball its a shame the rocks never won Parking is great at the venue During the basketball you have to use the outside lifts or you need a swipe to level 3 There is lots of toilets Never had a issues with the staff Great views from the disabled area to watch the game Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Basketball Glasgow rocks. The venue is really good and accessible 

There is plenty of wheelchair parking spaces in the car park and within the areana Great lot's of spaces and a flat curb Easy access lifts and G4S holds the doors open for you There is some but not easy to spot The staff are brilliant I recommend a basketball game batter than football 

Only thing is can be busy to get out after the games Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Amazing experience. From start to finish what a fantastic experience. For the size of event the Commonwealth Games are every volunteer and security/police officer help make this an enjoyable hassle free experience from start to finish of our day! I was very sceptical about the accessible parking from the very start, and although there is no parking at the venue, what a service!! I phoned up the accessible parking hotline and gave them the date, time, venue and event I had tickets for along with the client reference number, they done the rest Once at the Forge Shopping Centre the signage was very poor, the minibus took us straight to the door. Wheelchairs are taken to the side for airport style security check. Once through that the venue is accessed via a lift at the left side of the entrance where a steward is waiting to take you up.  O I used one of the toilets outside the viewing area though still in the arena. Plenty space in them and no problems at all for a powered chair. I would advise one thing, take your ticket with you!!! Schoolboy error, almost didn't get back in without my ticket!! :-D Could not fault any of the staff, from my initial phonecall re parking, to the security and driver at car park and the security and assistance staff at the venue!! First class!! Just a warning, you are only allowed to take in 500ml bottle of fluid! Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Cycledrome. New site yet wheelchair spectating areas for Commonwealth Games were very poor. CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient. No negative issues, signage perhaps could be expanded. Hand rails, toilet sear etc... Were not contrasting colours from standard white furniture. On the day the staff I met did not have answers to questions I had e.g. audio commentary. Wheelchair area positioning behind each bend are a poor design offering only 75% view of action. Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Main Entrance and Games Hall. Considering this is a brand new building felt overall accessibility was disappointing.

Although they has the stick out style signs these were not always obvious from a wheelchair height. In the main concourse on the upper level there was one accessible toilet.

Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome 100m dash ...Plenty of parking, great cafe, good loos and loads of sport thrown in! One of the largest dedicated Blue Badge car parks I've seen in a long time. Plenty of space to transfer from the car to the wheelchair.  The parking bays are are about 100m from the main entrance. The signposting from the main road was not as clear as it couldh've been. We drove to the wrong entranc Getting into the building from the dedicated parking was fine with a level surface; albeit around 100m to travel. The accessible doors were of the push pad type.

Although they has the stick out style signs these were not always obvious from a wheelchair height. In the main concourse on the upper level there was one accessible toilet. Others were in the avenue between the upper consource and the viewing areas Staff were helpful and knowledgable. A great place to visit to see the sporting events. A little more signage on the approach roads would help visitors. Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Jogging along. Not the best views. Lifts might be small for some people. Signage hard to read. Really accessible parking Very accessible and very spacious. The smoked glass impairs the view from the wheelchair viewing area. Quite dark in places. Easy to access. Maybe more toilets and better signs? Very nice. Some signs, particularly by the lifts, were hard to read. Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Gosh it's warm in here!. Viewing felt limited. Only one accessible toilet outside on the level. Really accessible parking. No drop kerb at bus stop. Velodrome quite accessible but the view is limited. Only one disabled toilet out site on the level. Spacious with lots of handrails. Very nice. No parking at main entrance during games."
St. Enoch Shopping Centre,"St. Enoch Shopping Centre St. Enoch's review. It was okay Taxi was good, dinner was good and was talking.

Clean and fresh toilet. Nice low sink and mirror for anyone in a wheelchair.      St. Enoch Shopping Centre St. Enoch's review. Shopping Centre, I come here sometimes, I find it easy to get about.  Some shops are better than others. Some need to be accessible for everybody, walking in the middle is fine but they are hard to get out. Not signposted well especially if you don't know the building. Not accessible as you don't know where they are, needing to walk around to find them. Friendly, I like to come into St. Enoch's  St. Enoch Shopping Centre Disabled Toilet. It was good to visit the St. Enoch Centre to see about disabled access. I got a taxi. Good entrance, lift, ramp and signs The signs don't really tel you where it is.   St. Enoch Shopping Centre Glasgow St. Enoch Centre. Boom Battle Bar with different activities in it. I got a taxi Good entrance, lift, ramp and signs No toilet roll paper in the paper holder, no soap. Very welcoming  St. Enoch Shopping Centre GDA event in Glasgow. Visiting the shops we are reviewing I walked and got a train. It was easy to find the entrance. There was a lift a ramp and signage. There is no accessible toilet in the management suite, only on the ground floor. Unable to use because I would need a sara stedy or a turning frame as I can't use the slide to transfer Staff were helpful even in the stores that were less accessible. The shop I accessed 
Inside Out was tight for a powerchair
Hamley's, good roomy aisles
The Works, Good aisles
Quiz, not great. Can't buy online, so need to try on, no changing room was accessible. Too loud but staff were helpful. 
All shops were on the level which was helpful St. Enoch Shopping Centre GDA event at the St. Enoch Centre. The boomerang in the games shop and the remote control games. A good space. I got a taxi. I was only able to find the entrance with help from someone. There were stairs, but also a lift and a ramp They need an accessible toilet on the second floor. I was happy to pay at Hamley's. The staff were friendly I felt safe when I come with GDA, but would not come by myself. Everybody was nice. Quiz was crowded with stuff, no one asked if I needed any help.

I enjoyed writing my review I got a taxi It was easy to find the entrance, there was a lift a ramp and signage Didn't check the toilet. Staff were excellent.  St. Enoch Shopping Centre a alright shopping centre. St Enoch centre is OK for their  shops but not very good for their changing places I find the disabled parking very good at St Enoch centre and if you are getting the bus. all bus. inside and outside all flat. !there is a few lifts which they are quite big. there is a changing places but the hoist is  always not  working which  is terrible and the staff seems to use it a lot   St. Enoch Shopping Centre Disabled bays. I have been parking inside the centre for a weeks because of the bad weather, I would usually park on the street outside with free parking for blue badge holders.
I had noticed it was difficult to get a disabled bay as most were taken by vehicles which were not displaying blue badges      St. Enoch Shopping Centre Shopping Centre Check St Enoch Centre. One entrance is easy to access, the atmosphere of the outside areas were good.  Difficult in getting a parking space. Managed to get a parking space but had extreme difficulty in getting one. One of the entrances to the building was good but the other entrance accessibility was poor. On this occasion we didn't visit the accesible loo. Staff were difficult to find and they weren't very easy to recognise as staff. It is easy to get to from the City Centre. Public transport is very accessible. Spacing between tables in the eating areas is poor and movement around the shops is ok. St. Enoch Shopping Centre Quite a surprise ...Looking for somewhere to shelter from the summer rain we spotted a sign saying St. Enoch Centre. Not sure what to expect it turned out to be really good. Easy to wheel in and around, plenty of space for two powerchairs walking together, and great facilities. Not too sure about local transport as we were too preoccupied with getting shelter out of the rain. The Centre has loads of shops all with easily accessible open fronts. There's plenty of space to walk around and wide enough so we could walk as two powerchair users side by side and have a conversation; can't do that in most places.

The surface was easy to wheel on, the areas clearly signposted, The Centre has an accessible toilet. It has a RADAR lock. It is spacious and well appointed.  Really enjoyed visiting but ran out of time. Impressed by the range of shops - everything from the specialist sweet shop through to the gents outfitters, the aromatics shop, and the cafe areas."
Riverside Museum,"Riverside Museum Accesible toilets a disgrace and tainted the visit.I have visited many times before, however, poor access to the toilets made me look through fresh eyes and closer at other aspects of the museum.    Its not a great layout for someone with limited mobility.  Everything seems to be packed in minimisin  Mostly all on one level, with a lift to access upstairs.  The downstairs is quite cluttered, there is very little space in places with very little room to pass people who are looking at exhibits.

Access to the toilets is terrible and I have written about this as well. The accessible toilet is a disgrace. The door is not wide enough and too heavy. I'm not sure how a wheelchair user would be able to access it.

Tried to open the door while on Scooter and wasnt able to, got off scooter and managed to open and stop it closing with my foot.  Trying to get Scooter in   Riverside Museum love going to the River Side Museum Glasgow. the museum is great   museum with great disabled access such as wide entrance, wide space in the museum to move around with a wheelchair  and a  great changing places toilet.   good  place to  go to  learn about old transport a lot of disabled spaces, no public buses goes  to the museum but you  can get a bus to Partick bus station and walk across all on the  flat outside the museum and inside theres lifts to get upstairs.  everything is on eye level a great changing places toilet and there is signs pointing to it the staff is   very helpful and friendly  Riverside Museum Be transported to another world. The riverside museum is the new home of the transport museum and Tall ship the Glen Lee in Glasgow. The museum has a very wide entrance and Automatic doors. The layout inside the museum is very spacious and easy to move around. There are lots of interesting exhibits  There are lots of disabled parking spaces available at the front of the museum. It is also a registered stop on the Glasgow tour bus which has wheelchair access. There are 2 cafes within the museum so it is easy to get confused as they are not very well signed. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. One is a restaurant and the other is a small cafe so serves different meals.  The quayside entrance to the museum is often used as a skate park for skateboarding so be There are some very spacious toilets toilets with handrails. Sadly no changing places facility that I could see, Staff are very friendly and helpful and happy to help I loved seeing the old Glasgow teams and one of the first wheelchairs. I also love the replica of an old cobbled Street in Glasgow with horse and cart. Riverside Museum Great space, pity about the red cord.Great circulation space and excellent exhibits. In some places there was not enough space to bide a wee while you took in the exhibits and watch info films without getting in the way of other visitors. I arrived by Hop On bus but plenty free parking. Physical space was generally good but at times I felt I was in the way as I took time to take in all the info thus causing a log jam. Lighting is low in parts, some exhibits, even cars, are mounted high up on the walls. General info signs are light green dots on lime green background. Not sure how t A well equipped and spacious loo combining baby changing. What a pity there does not appear to be a changing places toilet (it might have been hidden away). It has lost a star as the red cord was tied firmly to the hand rail. Preventing both the rail from dropping and the alarm from activating. I is Programme Manager Annie was very helpful, took my complaint and did what she could with the cord but it ended two feet from the floor. I filled in a complaint. Annie was very welcoming of my feedback. A great day out. Take your picnic and sit by the Clyde. Combine with The Tall Ship. Riverside Museum Great access for all. The museum is very accessible and wheelchair friendly throughout. There are no stairs to tackle to gain access to the building and the staff were very friendly and helpful too. Attractions were also extremely wheelchair user friendly as they had lifts to view the vehicles for e There are lots of disabled bays No stairs to tackle, lifts  Very helpful and friendly  Riverside Museum Great place for all the family. This lovely museum is very hands-on and accessible. It charts the history of transport in Scotland and other parts of the world and is full of fascinating information and stories. The outside area is great too, with the giant sofa and armchair to keep the younger memb I didn't drive but the disabled parking looked convenient. Very accessible. Most of the museum if flat with wide doors. Lovely shop too and it is roomy enough for a wheelchair user to be comfortable Accessible loos on each floor and good lift in between. Friendly and helpful You can there there by the 100 bus, by train (Partick Station) on walking/cycling along the Clyde. Lovely place to visit. Riverside Museum For All Ages. The Museum is accessible although there are a few parts with stairs that some people may have to miss out on. There is an awesome gift shop with a range of gifts. My favourite part of the museum was an old fashioned cobbled street with lots of old fashioned shops. I think there is disabled parking although I am not 100% sure. The accessibility is good but not great as there are stairs up to buses or trains in some parts of the museum which wheelchair users would probably have to miss out on There are some stairs in the museum  The staff were happy to answer any questions we had. I did not want to leave here! It was masses of fun! :-) I did not notice an accessible loo but I feel it is the kind of place the probably would have one Riverside Museum Great museum with great disabled facilities. Found the museum extremely wheelchair accessible with plenty of space to move around between the displays. Great toilet facilities with one large changing places toilet on the ground floor and another disabled toilet on the second floor. Lovely cafe and f      Riverside Museum Possibly best museum ever!. Loved this place... Which is even more incredible seeing as I'm not really fussed about trains, cars, buses or transport in general! As much as it is about Transport it also gives great insight into Glasgow history. Blue Badge parking spaces. Plus can get there using bus from City Centre I believe. You can visit the Tall Ship at the same time. Amazing! Everything has been thought about - from the entrance to the different exhibits (some with their own platform lifts) to the full length glass viewing areas to the enormous lift to the information panels that have BSL - and much much more! Brilliant - spacious, clean and tidy. Super helpful from door staff to cafe staff and everyone in between. Definitely go - it's a fascinating way to spend a few hours! Great fun for someone of any age.. Riverside Museum So good we ran out of time!. Not the usual image of a museum. From arriving at the front door access was easy and also presented some welcome surprises! Dedicated blue badge parking bays are situated close to the main entrance. Arriving by accessible taxi I was dropped off at the Taxi point which was a short distance from the main entrance. There's also a bus service from the city centre to Riverside and the city sightseeing bus also stops there. The museum has great access. There were plenty of loos, a massive lift to get to the upper level and exhibits arranged so you had a reasonable view from wheelchair height. The icing on the cake were the lifts to get up onto the railway locomotives' and experience the drivers view. With plenty of accessible toilets the museum caters for all requirements. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Particularly in the cafe where we stopped for lunch. It was easy to find room for two wheelchair users and the furniture was moveable to make things easier. The sheer size of the museum meant we had run out of our allocated time before we got to see everything. There were some really good accessibility features such as the BSL display screens. Riverside Museum Transport through the ages. Located by the riverside this museum is fantastic! As the title says, this is a look at all different modes of transport throughout the ages from bicycles to steam engines and everything in between!! By bus - the tourist sightseeing buses, like local buses allow one wheelchair, stop directly outside the museum. Unsure about local buses.
By taxi - the taxi drop off point is directly outside the museum. If one is needed for return journey, don't forget to ask the driver for a phone number to get  Absolutely fantastic for wheelchairs. Large automatic doors at entrance with level access throughout although on 2 levels, this is no issue as the lifts are among the biggest lifts I have been in. There are smaller box lifts that take you to the drivers platform of the steam engines so you get a tra There is a good number of accessible toilets and they are a good size so very easy to manoeuvre. Not much contact with staff but helpful when required To the back of the transport museum is docked a tall ship/museum that has access. Riverside Museum Riverside Museum. Excellent access.  Myself and my wife were able to easily gain entry into the building (I use a power wheelchair and my wife was in a mobility scooter), we were able to get into the ground floor restaurant easily, and had no problems getting around inside the museum in general.  Th A row of disabled parking bays are present next to the main entrance.     Riverside Museum Easy Access. It's an 'easy visit' with a cafe that does coffee and cake.  You don't really need to like cars etc to go along. Easy blue badge parking on the main road in so lots of space to manoever.  About 12 spaces adjacent to the entrance.  Spaces slightly short (ie don't have the 1.2m markings at the end), so reverse in and use the wide footpath if required. Flush threshold at the same access as all other visitors.  Auto doors so no push pad opperation. Signage a bit poor (as with other parts of the building), and a standard type accessible WC. Just friendly and asked if we needed any help. Museum spaces felt big with no issues for turning etc.  Lighting quite dim with not much natural daylight.  Free access and free parking (Blue badge holders only)."
Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,"Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Meditations on the Mind. Kelvingrove has always been a family tradition for me so it felt particularly special to visit for the first time after the Pandemic.  It’s an old Victorian building with a Gothic atmosphere, especially in the fading Autumn light just before closing.  I love the way that the There are buses onto the street outside the Museum but I can’t say if they’re accessible as I came by car.  The nearest subway (Kelvinhall)  is half a mile away and the nearest train stations (Partick, Exhibition Centre and Charing Cross) are about one mile away.  There are ten disabled spaces altog There is a push button disabled entry at the Lower Level entry and this is also where the lift is located.  The lift is a bit tight for a powerchair but it is manageable and there is plenty of room to access all the exhibits in the galleries.  The paintings were at a good height for me to view in my Toilets . There are three disabled toilets available; I was unable to visit them on this visit but will try the next time. Staff were very helpful and approachable I felt reasonably covid confident while visiting; there were screens in front of reception, hand sanitiser available and lots of space to social distance. Kelvingrove is a must see and I will definitely be back! Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Mixed feelings. Plenty of disabled bays to choose from. Only trouble for me was that the entrance closest was shut. Had to go to the opposite side of the building and were told we couldn't take the car any closer. Didn't see any dropped kerbs around that area which makes it so much harder for wheelc      Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum A great place to meet in troubled times. Met up with grandkids this weekend, feeling very safe even in the heat of covid, shame that the café's shut but entirely understandable. Arrived in our disabled vehicle, no problem with parking. Plenty of buses around if you are brave enough. Entrance is absolutely fine, the lift is a little tight, but manageable with a couple of friends as well. We did not use the toilets, but they certainly are well signposted and numerous As expected, great reception from the staff, always helpful and cheery. Booking is online, straightforward. Everyone is masked, with good space around the museum, so no crowding. Single queue for one Dali painting. We'll certainly be back, hopefully vaccinated
next time. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Great place to visit.Amazing place to spend the day.  Plenty of space among exhibits to manoeuvre scooter, apart from one exhibit and that's Dali's Christ of Saint John of the Cross  (though you can see it fine).   There is a cafe, though the only issue is the height that the milk/sugar/stirrers are It is a paid for carpark, though blue badges are free with plenty of disabled parking at the rear.  Also with plastic ramps between each bay to get up the pavement. Easy access, with a lift to every level, though on one floor you need to use a stair lift, and this is only at one end so you need to go back to it.  Every other floor you can go right round the level.

The lift is not big enough to turn in, so you need to back in or back out of it. Accessible toilets on every level, though a bit of thought needed for the location of the paper towels and soap dispensers as they are not easy to reach.   Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Fantastic Museum. Even although I am I weegie [Glaswegian] I haven't been here since I was a child.
I came to see the da Vinci drawings. There was 12 drawings from the Royal collection they had been 'acquired' by Charles II hundreds of years ago.
I didn't realize the museum shut at 5 o'clock sharp The venue has plenty of parking. Being at the heart of the West End there are plenty of buses from the city center. I came off the bus, crossed that the traffic lights and tried to enter by the front entrance [it's actually the back as the front looks onto the park around the other side]. I couldn't see the access at the front steps and there was no signage which I find a bit strange for this iconic building.
I  The toilets are large clean facilities. One of the toilets has a changing bench for adults, I don't need it myself but I love when I see these things. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, apart from when the where 'throwing us out' We are just so lucky in Glasgow to have these free museums. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Enough Space Even for a Dinosaur!. An iconic Glasgow building - worth visiting for that alone - 'Kelvingrove Art Galleries & Museum' stands proudly in the cities west end.
There are a wide range of galleries as well as both temporary and permanent exhibits.
During my visit, ’Dippy' the Dinosaur was  In the city centre, there are various transport options.
The nearest underground is Kelvin subway station (on Byres Road), about a 5 minute walk away.
The nearest train station is Patrick, about a 15 minute walk away.
There are lots of buses in Glasgow,and even the tourist hop-on hop-on bus stops ar There is an expanse of space in the museum, with wide passageways and smooth flooring throughout - making it ideal if moving around in a wheelchair.
There are staff at desks near the entrances as well as around the museum, who are happy to help answer any questions.
You can also pick up a free map o I am giving this a high rating as I was impressed that there are accessible toilets on every floor.
I only saw standard accessible toilets, but I believe there is one with a changing plinth.
Sometimes the toilets were tucked off the main corridors slightly, nearer to the rooms of exhibits, so some e I did not have reason to speak with staff, but they are easily seen around the place and I felt I could have asked for their help if I needed it.
There are staffed desks at each of the entrances.
The museum was quite busy, with a mixture of visitors including families and school groups, everyone see It's a Glasgow Museum = It's Free to Visit!!
Be there for 1pm (most days - check online) and hear the magnificent organ being played! It echoes round the whole building, a bonus free concert to enjoy.
Has a good cafe as well as museum shop, but they don't mind you bringing a packed lunch either.

Signage is good. Several cafes. Large room with grab bars and extra arm, red cord in place. Helpful but busy There are many educational talks, concerts and children's events which are free. I attended a very well structured craft day attached to and including entry to the Charles Rennie Mackintosh exhibition. This was at a reasonable cost. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Great Place for a Day Out!. A very interesting place which makes for a fun day out! Car park was close to the museum and easy to find. There is an alternative entrance at the back of the building which allows access for wheelchair users and those who may have difficulty walking up the steps at the main entrance. Lift access was good also. Great place.

Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Great place to visit!. The Art Gallery and Museum has great access for wheelchair users. From the street entrance the building looks inaccessible but you can enter easily via the car park entrance onto the lower ground floor of the museum. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would suggest pi The car park has disabled parking spots but can get busy, however there are usually spaces available. The car park is close to the museum entrance.

There are copies if floor plans directly in front of you and the woman at the reception desk poin There are disabled toilets on all levels.

Great place to visit, lots to see. There are rooms with videos playing and interactive boards and these are at a good level. I would visit again! Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum A work of art!. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip. The building is very spacious throughout so ideal for wheelchairs. Access via lifts is seemless and every area of the museum is accessible (although the shop is quite tight). Food in the cafe was superb and table service makes it extremely easy to use! Plenty of disabled bays (8) at the rear of the gallery. Only down side is that the lowered kerb is at the centre of the bay's which is a little frustrating. Good access from the rear of the gallery. Level access from the car park to the automatic entry doors in to the building. Toilets have changing table and lots of handrails etc. The area is quite restrictive space-wise as a result of the amount of adaptations included. Staff were very attentive and helpful. From the staff in the cafe to the helpers at the arts and crafts activity area, they couldn't do enough for everyone. The park at the rear of the gallery is lovely. There is quite a slope to negotiate so some people may struggle if on their own. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Plenty to see and explore. It was fairly easy to park, get in and get around the museum. Parking was fairly easy with dedicated Blue Badge bays a short distance from the rear entrance to the museum. The route from the parking was level and easy to negotiate as a wheelchair user. Overall, the museum is a good experience as it is fairly easy to get in, to get around, to see the many exhibits, and to find a loo or get some refreshments.

We particualry liked the height of the various interpretation boards as they were easy to read and even had space under them so you coukld  The accessible toilets were varied. The one we used on the Lower Ground floor with the changing bench wasn't great as there was very little space between the bench and the loo which made moving aorund with a wheelchair / powerchair difficult. That said, the loo on the main floor was very good with p Staff were very helpful in giving directions when we weren't too sure which way to head for.  Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Kelvingrove Art Gallery - A must for all tourists visiting Glasgow. For such an old and iconic building, the wheelchair user access at KAGM is fantastic and has improved dramatically since it's refurbishment. Staff are extremely friendly and the disabled toilets come with all the modern equipment yo There are a large number of disabled parking spaces outside the main entrance at the back of the museum. Due to the sheer number of visitors it receives, space availability can be difficult at times. It would be good to see a larger presence of a parking warden where possible to help regulate. For t The main entrance has two automatic doors which operate with a push-pad system. On one occasion this was broken, however staff at the nearby reception desk were on hand to help keep the door open. There are two lifts, one each side of the main linking corridor that allow wheelchair users to access t The disabled toilets are very, very impressive. There is one in the main entrance basement near the right hand side lift, and two on the ground floor of the main gallery in each of the two wings. Each toilet is incredibly spacious with plenty of room for manoeuvring. There are also height adjustable The staff are very helpful and incredibly friendly. They were happy to assist with any questions about access or about any of the exhibits. Before it's refurbishment, access to KAGM meant travelling through the narrow and dark basement archives to use a service lift to enter. Whilst this was perhaps interesting, it did not give a good impression of the museum. Since it's 2006 refurbishment, the museum has become easily accessible. I hav"
O2 Academy,"O2 Academy Return Of The Mack!. This was my third visit to O2 Academy Glasgow and I'm really pleased to say that it was just as amazing as before.  Staff were absolutely fantastic both on the night and also before it in helping me gain a last-minute wheelchair space when the event was officially sold out but I No changes since my last visit; no disabled parking available but we parked on an industrial estate nearby and there was also a car-park down the side-street which was full. There are bus-stops and a subway nearby, however, I don't know whether they are accessible or not; I couldn't find SPT's acces Staff guided us safely through ramped accessible entrances all the way to our seats on the viewing platform which they had reserved for us. I had a fantastic view. Staff said they would help me access this with a Radar key if I needed to use it but I didn't visit it this time so sorry, I can't comment. The staff make a huge difference to the experience of this venue; I felt safe throughout from arrival to  leaving the venue.   They helped clear a path for me again through the crowds, even outside the venue and they are all helpful, welcoming, funny and friendly! My PA wore a mask and used sanitiser but he was probably the only one in the building who did apart from me so it's probably not the best place to come if you're worried about Covid; I still am but I have to risk some things as I need music and art to live too.  I'd definitely recommend the venue it O2 Academy ""LIFE AIN'T ALWAY EMPTY!"". Fontaines D.C.  were absolutely amazing; they electrified the crowd and made me think even more about the issues they raise in their poetic delivery.  This gig was also special to me as it was my first indoor concert since the pandemic and it certainly did not disappoint.  No disabled parking available but we parked on-street nearby and there was also a car-park down the side-street.  There are bus-stops and a subway nearby, however, I don't know whether they are accessible or not; I couldn't find SPT's access staement on their website but perhaps it's just well-hidde Staff guided us through ramped accessible entrances all the way to our seats on the viewing platform which they had reserved for us.  I had a great view and even although it was very crowded, I was able to move further along to get an even better view. Staff said they would help me access this with a Radar key if I needed to use it but I didn't visit it this time so sorry, I can't comment. Staff were incredible, helpful, friendly and welcoming.  On seeing that the pavement was very crowded outside the venue, they even escorted us safely through the crwd and right across the road.  They could not have done any more and this was before the later tragedy in London’s O2. So it wasn’t like This was not the place to come if you were worried about Covid; by the very nature of the event and the venue, you had to get close to people.  In my own case, I had decided that I would take the risk as I needed to balance being able to live my life with staying well and I had come to the point whe O2 Academy Prog metal and accessibility. First big gig since my access needs increased significantly, and I was really impressed. Arrived by taxi and was dropped off in front of the venue As I’d been advised by email, I approached staff in front of the venue who checked my name off a list. 
My partner and I were shown in before doors opened. We were shown all the places I could sit, the disabled toilets were pointed out and I was told they needed a radar key (and that I could borrow   Couldn’t fault them. They were proactive, helpful, and provided all the information I needed. 
I felt like I’d been listened to, treated respectfully, and that the staff genuinely wanted to make sure I had a good gig experience.  O2 Academy Good music venue. I read the reviews on the site before attending so was prepared for any issues but I’m pleased to say I didn’t have any. I went to see a rock orchestra, An interesting concept, but musically mehhhh ????. Anyway, I am not reviewing the music just the place. I took a taxi to the venue, there were no issues dropping me off close bye. There are bus stops on both sides of the road servicing the southside and city centre. The subway is a couple of hundred yards away. On street parking is limited. When I approached the front door, A steward took my name and showed me to the fire exit at the side. The ramp inside is slightly steep but manageable. Once inside the venue most areas are accessible via ramps. Although fairly small the toilet was clean and manageable, and I am using an electric wheelchair. Previous comments talked about clutter and Cleanliness but I’m pleased to say they have upped their game. The staff are fantastic. We were shown to a accessible area on a raised platform. This area is not exclusively for disabled people so feels a lot more inclusive.  O2 Academy Meeting the first British UFC world champion!. Good access, staff couldn't of done any more but covid precautions were non existent There were little to no parking options at the venue so we just parked at our hotel, premier inn Glasgow City Centre South hotel witch was roughly half a mile from the venue. Warning, potholes everywhere. No problems, great access. You enter through a ramped side door, go through another door and then arrive at the wheelchair balcony witch gave a fantastic view of the stage! 1 flaw I would mention however is that the people in the seats behind the wheelchair users would have a slightly restricted vie Didn't use or see the accessible loos so cant comment. Staff were fantastic. One member of staff in particular was superb, she asked us throughout the show if we were okay and if we needed anything. She also told us to stay seated and Michael Bisping would come to meet us after the show. Didn't get her name, sorry. Didn't feel COVID CONFIDENT AT ALL. Didn't need to show any tests upon entry, out of about 1000 people - not one mask. They say all the right things on their website, they say but don't do. O2 Academy Handy viewing platform. With wheelchair spaces on a natural level platform, and an accessible platform, this venue is ideal for wheelchair users. Tickets can be purchased online and a simple email to get carer ticket and send evidence of disability. My only problem was that the venue was full and it Plenty of on street parking. Level access t the side of the venue. Accessible toilet is at the back so if it is a sold out gig, it is very difficult to get to and from the wheelchair space. Staff are very helpful  O2 Academy Awesome staff and amazing gig. I’ve been to two concerts here in the last few months and both were fantastic experiences. I absolutely love live music and tend to stick to the SSE Hydro but I didn’t want to miss these bands. 
You buy one ticket online then email the venue for your carer ticket whic There is no official parking, we parked in a nearby carpark . There is a bus stop right outside Once in through the fire exit, there are double doors that staff lead you through and inbetween these doors is a steep ramp, I need to get them to open the next doors so I can go up quickly in my powerchair, I would need assistance in my manual wheelchair. Once in, the accessible platform is right t The toilet is accessible, but very poor. It has folded up manual chairs to the right of the seat so I could not line my chair up. It would be extremely cramped to get a carer in to assist and I almost fell transferring. It is not especially clean or well lit and there is no space to turn. The staff are amazing! Without the helpful staff this could be quite a stressful experience. They are super helpful, walking ahead and clearing space through people so you can get in and out, and use the toilet. There are lots of staff about wearing jackets that easily identify them. They are really I really enjoyed the gigs here, I forgot I was even in my wheelchair at times as I just like part of the crowd; not separate or different. The crowds have been super nice as well, Glasgow is a friendly city. I will definitely go back- but I’ll arrive early! O2 Academy Superb Staff. Wheel chair access is through a side door and staff come out to find you and bring you in before everyone else comes in. Great view from above and behind the standing area. There is no parking, disabled or otherwise at the venue but we arrived early enough to park quite close in a side street for free. When booking a carer's ticket they give you clear info about how to access. There is a separate queue for those who need help to enter. Staff come out to collect/assist you to enter through a side door before everyone else enters. They guided me to a suitable place with a good clear view. I was told There was an accessible toilet which required a radar key. A member of staff wheeled me from where I was sitting to the loo, went to get a key and then waited to return me to my seat. It wasn't the cleanest but good otherwise. if you needed to transfer to the loo, you'd have to move a bin. The red c Couldn't have been more helpfull. They helped me enter, helped me while there and then parted the crowds as I left to help me return to my car. 6 out of 5! It's good but make sure you get there early if you want to park nearby. O2 Academy Macklemore Gemini Tour at O2 Academy. I had a fantastic night at the Macklemore concert at O2 Academy in Glasgow.  This was the first time I'd been here and I had heard mixed reviews about its wheelchair accessibility but it was great from the minute I made myself known to security to the minute the Sadly, there was no disabled parking available so we had to park on the street in a precarious postion, it wasn't even really a parking space. Staff took us through a side entrance; there is a manageable ramp and staff are really helpful.  We were then taken to reserved places and seating at the edge of the bar.  This floor is raised so there is a great view and you really feel part of the experience.  Staff tell you where they are if you  The toilet was pointed out to me and they said I might need to get the key from one of the staff.  I actually didn't go there but I promise that next time I will.... They were all very helpful and Amy was assigned to look after us.  She told me where she would be standing if I needed her but I could see that I could have caught the attention of security upstairs too if I had needed it. AMAZING!!! even Macklemore said 'WHAT AN ******* CROWD!  The supports were also brilliant too and I would definitely come back to this venue.  Not having to worry about access issues and the staff being so nice really added to the whole night. O2 Academy Pretty challenging access but amazing staff. Access wasn't brilliant, we came in a side door and while there was a space reserved for us in a raised area, its not just for wheelchair users, so I spent a lot of the night having to ask people to move so my brother could see the gig.  Parking is a chal We ended up parking on a side street on a double yellow line - the bouncers said it should be fine. It was but we weren't all that happy leaving the car there. We couldn't find any other options.  

Once we were out of the car we had to battle with the horrific pavements - lots of potholes, bumps, Could be a lot better. We came in a side entrance which was quite tricky to negotiate.  See comment about viewing area above - really not great. 
We had backstage passes but couldn't get backstage as it wasn't accessible. Instead we had to go outside again, round the back of the building and back i  Staff were absolutely brilliant and went out of their way to help us. It was just hard work trying to get around the building. We had a great night thanks to the super helpful staff and amazing Rodrigo y Gabriella but it was hard work getting into and around the venue. It could be a lot lot better quite easily e.g. if there was a couple of disabled parking bays (or suggestions on the website where to park), a dedicated whee"
Silverburn Shopping Centre,"Silverburn Shopping Centre Toilets with person hoist. Visited with severally disabled person and it was good to find a toilet with hoist. A rare occurence in these parts. Shame only have one. Key for toilet from mall reception.
Only bad point is could do with more disabled spaces as frequently full.      Silverburn Shopping Centre love shopping. I think  silverburn is on of nice shopping centre there is a lot of disabled bays around the centre the centre is  all flat and I find most of the shops is big and wide for wheelchairs there is a fantastic changing places   Silverburn Shopping Centre Truly accessible shopping. a shopping centre with excellent parking with both outdoor and with a covered multi-storey direct with access to the shops. the centre includesa Shopmobility area from which to borrow scooters, wheelchairs etc and the wide aisles and the spaces of the Centre beingwell lit  always travelled there  by car– excellent parking facilities. And level access from the multi-storey undercover directly to shopping areas. A number of taxi stops plus public transport is also available. It can get a little crowded particularly on to holidays especially Christmas for a shopping centre, it is one of the best that I have visited. The shops arealso generally fullyaccessible as all the restaurants. There is even a spa which I believe is accessible also. We public areas are kept very clean and hazard free. there are a good selection of accessible toilets. There are also I believe large adult changing facilities. Some of the accessible toilets are easier to use than others. The new ones near the Marks & Spencer's end of the centre are considerably more difficult because of concertina doors. Possibly be the staff at the Shopmobility are considerate, kind and excellent. They make the whole experience untroubled and allow many of us to maintain a level of independence which is greatly appreciated.  Silverburn Shopping Centre Easy access shopping. Effortless shopping loads and I mean of disabled parking spaces. Shopmobility at the entrance and well signposted. Electric doors into Centre so no assistance required. Toilets throughout and all large enough to get a wheelchair in without a struggle. Shops all on the level. Ea Buses regular from most areas of Glasgow. Ample disabled parking inside multistory and outside too Access is excellent all doors to the outside are automatic and there are no doors into the shops or restaurants Disabled toilets are positioned along the length of the mall. They were clean although on a few occasions soap has not been available. The toilets are large enough to comfortably maneuver my wheelchair Not really needed any staff except in the Shopmobility and they are very helpful. There is a customer service desk at the Centre point of the mall if you tequire help. Also patrolling security guards should you need someone I am lucky to live close to Silverburn and it’s my go to place when I can because it’s easy. I have ME and chronic pain so energy used unnecessary is a waste. I can even go there myself and that makes me feel independent and that’s very important Silverburn Shopping Centre Silverburn shopping centre. Loads of disabled parking, all shops are downstairs, shops with 2 levels have an accessible lift. There’s a lift up to the cinema. 
Plenty of room in shops and between shops.      Silverburn Shopping Centre Accesibility Check of Silverburn Shopping Centre. Free shopmobility service.  Excellent range of facilities eg. 27-30 mobile scooters and manual wheelchairs.  Free electric wheelchair.  Disabled toilets, taxi calling service.  Provide free eye tests and scooter training.  Carer’s parking permit.  Fr Not easy to get from Glasgow City Centre by Car. Public transport is unreliable. There was a lift.  There was enough room when moving around stalls, eating areas. We visited the disabled toilets so we acknowledged that they were there. Easy to recognize staff. They were sometimes available if we needed any help. I would recommend it to other people and would visit again.
Recommendations I would give are for staff to become more visible so people know where to go to if people need any help. Silverburn Shopping Centre Barrier free shopping. Silverburn is an accessible shopping centre close to the M77 and with plenty of disabled parking bays. There is a wide range of shops, restaurants and cafes in the centre, which also houses a large cinema. I travelled by car and parked in the multi-storey car park. There are disabled parking bays all around the centre, but I prefer the multi-storey as it has lots of disabled bays on the ground floor and provides great shelter from the rain. Each entrance has automatic door entrances that I can use with ease. There are auto revolving doors, which are large enough that I can use in my manual chair. The doors have a speed adjustment for those with reduced mobility. Signage for toilets etc was very clear throughout. The toilets I used were next to the food court. They were spacious,  clean and had everything I needed. I have marked them as a 4 star, because I feel like they have missed the opportunity to install a changing places loo in such a large space. I didn't have much use for staff as the venue allows you to be independent. However, I have previously seen staff members be proactive when dealing with challenging behaviour etc. One particular staff member was very understanding when my son dropped a full milkshake on the walkway through the centr This centre has everything you need for a great days shopping for all the family. Silverburn Shopping Centre Very good access & facilities.We had a day to spend while on Glasgow & it was absolutely pouring outside. We parked in the multi-storey car park which has usual disabled parking spaces, with large accessible lifts to the shopping centre. There was easy access to all the shops, we also went to the ci In the multi-storey car park, using Blue Badge Automatic door at main entrance, level access with plenty of space in the shopping centre for manoeuvrability. Appeared to be lots of disabled toilets at various places throughout the centre. Adequate size for the powerchair, clean & fresh   Silverburn Shopping Centre Best Changing Facilities!. Silverburn Shopping Centre is, in my opinion, the best shopping centre in Glasgow where access is concerned. A reasonable amount of disabled parking places, but the car park can get very busy. Open plan layout and spacious feel, with a wide, automatic door at the entrance for wheelchair users. At the moment Silverburn is all on one level, (I think they are currently expanding, so that may change in the future). Some of the larger shops like H&M and Debenhams are on two floors, but they ha Silverburn has the best accessible toilets for miles around! They are clean and well looked after, and they have a large pull down changing table which is big enough for an adult to lie on. My son is ten and needs to be changed regularly when we are out and about. They really do have the best and cl Staff are very polite and helpful, especially those who work in the toilets. "
Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station,"Glasgow Queen Street Station is easily accessible and is located near to the Buchanan shopping Centre and various restaurants in the area. Cold building/waiting area, trains delayed. Staff are okay. Since it’s reconstruction, Glasgow queen street station is a lot more appealing and is easily accessible which various entrances and exits.  I got off the train, walked up the stairs, scanned my ticket at the barrier and walked out. A satisfactory experience  Very good, nice and bright when you get upstairs coming from the low level trains The revamped Glasgow Queen Street took a bit of getting used to for me as I’m very light sensitive and I find it bright. The layout is good and the the new ticket gates accept my blind persons travel card so I can go through the barriers unaided, saves me waiting for a member of staff, I didn’t know about the location of the disabled accessible toilet which is located on the main concourse level, I went down stairs with a family member and they saw the accessible one on our return.  The staff in this station are very helpful and will take you to the correct train if needed.  Platforms 8 and 9 are down stairs which is fine for me, however the lifts for these platforms are sometimes out of order and there is no alternative to my knowledge. I am a guide dog owner with both sight and hearing impairments  I find easy when I access by Nor Hannover. You run into the barriers and staff can help you from there. I am a visually impaired student and this station is one of the easiests. I go to queen’s street station a lot, I always  book assistance for the train. I couldn’t  do without it though  it doesn’t  work out all the time.  Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station a nice  station. I was at a meeting years  ago  for when They started doing the station up so I was  looking forwards to see the station done up and  it didn't disappointed me I usually  get the bus in in to town and walk up to the station. disabled access is fantastic  .  it is all flat, every entrances is all accessibility. a big fantastic changing places but it is  downstairs so if the lift breaks there isn't anyway to get to the changing places   Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station Brilliant Service from Scotrail. Great service from a Scotrail Station. the transport to this station is good, only down side is no car parking but it is a station based within the town of Glasgow their is lifts at the new entrance at George square towards the toilets or the main station, also lifts to take you down to low level, their is announcements all the time with what platform the train is coming from I did not see this as they were charging NOW, but they do have a changing places toilet Staff go beyond for helping people with hidden disabilities to also making sure they get a good seat on the train to advising were to sit on the train, also I have autism so they find the quiet coach for me  Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station Train service. I travelled from Stirling train station to Glasgow Queen Street and had wonderful service from staff there and back! Great to be treated so well and be considered as deserving not a chore, really appreciated the staff. Didn't park but the train service excellent Lifts and ramps readily available Toilets on train at disabled area Their service excellent  Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station Glasgow Queen Street railway station. Glasgow Queen Street is one of two main rail stations in the city centre, and is located at one corner of Glasgow's George Square. The station has two levels: high level trains are a portal to the North, while low level services connect East to West Central Scot There are disabled parking spaces from the side entrance to the station. Low-level and high level trains can be accessed via a ramp which can be booked with Scotrail Passenger Assistance. Lifts connect upper to lower levels, these are accessed from the end platforms on the upper level, and are usually working although it might be good to check before you travel as otherwise there are a lot of stairs. There is a disabled toilet on the main concourse which can be opened using a Radar key, or   asking staff. Most of the staff are very helpful but as a one-time frequent user of the low level trains I did encounter some who were rude and unfriendly. One time I was refused the use of the ramp despite being there before the train arrived. The driver saved the day by getting out of the cabin and getting the  As a rail enthusiast, GLQ as we know it is a good place to spot or travel on trains to the north. Once the planned refurbishment goes ahead it should be even more accessible for disabled travellers. Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station Queen St Railway Station Lower Level. The lower level is part of the main Queen St Station its self and is only 2 platforms 8 and 9. These can be accessed by the stairs at either end of the platforms. One set is on the North Hanover St side of the Station. The other set are on the other side of the  There is no parking in the station area however there are a number of buses that pass by the station on the George Square side of the upper level. 
These are run by a number of companies including First Bus Glasgow. The best way to access the lower level is via the lifts that are next to platform 7 on the upper level. These  take you to just about the middle of each platform.
Queen St Station upper level is a busy station so allow your self time to get in and out of the upper level area 
If these lifts are no There is a wheelchair accessible toilet however the signage for this is not very good. The toilet is located to your left as you exit the  ticket barrier on the upper level. 
Station staff can point you in the right direction for this toilet The staff at the ticket barrier are always helpful and will do what they can to assist you as travel . The staff at the barrier also open the wheelchair access gates should you require them to do so. note that the trains on the lower level are running basically East To West across Central Scotland . Trains on this line  to and from Helensburgh, Milngaive , Cumbernauld, Coatbridge, Airdrie.
You can also get a train to Edinburgh on this line however this is not the same route as the upper level t Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station ScotRail at its best. Arriving at the station on the train staff were very quick and helpful to setup the ramps to allow us to embark. A good experience with the trains to hand, a taxi rank outside the door and not far to wheel to get an accessible bus to continue the journey. Four stars for Queen Street as we didn't have to ask for assistance or go looking for someone to help when we came to make the return journey. We were met on the concourse by the barriers and asked if we require assistance.

The ramps were quickly produced to board the train, the seats adjusted to A good accessible toilet is available near to the ticket office and opposite W H Smith. It's not easy to find as it doesn't have great signage.

Opening the door with a RADAR key you will find a large area with plenty of space to turn and manoeuvre. All the expected fittings were in place and it w Full marks for the staff from the people with the ramp to get off the train, through to the man greeting us when we came back for the return journey and the helpful guard who assisted our getting on to the train.  Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station Fantastic service. Good accessible toilet if you can find it!. Some of the best service we've come across at a station. The staff couldn't do more to help. There is a good accessible toilet round near the entrance to the underground, opposite the small WH Smith. Not sure as we arrived by train. I think there is some disabled parking in the car park. Good access. All on one level. Was easy to get around. There's a good accessible toilet but its hidden away round by the entrance to the underground station, opposite the small WH Smith. It requires a RADAR key. Staff went out of their way to look after us and came to find us 10-15 minutes before the train arrived. Its a shame you have to book disabled access ahead of time, and can't just turn up when you're ready. 
Thank you to staff that were so friendly and helpful. Glasgow Queen Street Railway Station The end of the line ...Level access throughout, helpful staff, and accessible toilet. No parking in the immediate area. Helpful staff, easy to get around, level access, and accessible loo. Accessible toilet off main concourse. Quite large, RADAR key, usual facilities.

Glasgow Science Centre,"Glasgow Science Centre Not sure if I'll be back.Travelled via car. Arrived and found a disabled space close to entrance but make sure you leave earlier incase you have to wait for one as it was really busy. I'm a wheelchair user and paths were easy to maneuver on. Staff were dotted about at the entrance but were no where       Glasgow Science Centre Very accessible venue for a wet day out indoors. This place is very easily accessible on my mobility scooter with a wide and smooth entrance and loads of things to see and do that I could access. As good and interesting for children and adults. All the staff were helpful and friendly. There is a res All the parking is a little way from the entrance but there are blue badge spaces and the walk from them to the museum is flat. Public transport is available from Glasgow city centre. There were no steps and a large lift to access the three floors. There is also another smaller lift if you walk past the large one. Signage is reasonable if you look up. In both the theatre and panetarium there were a good number of wheelchair spaces with regular seats next to them on the back row s There was a disabled toilet on each floor but the downstairs one was hard to get in and to do so you had to block the entrance to the men's toilet which also made it hard to reverse out. The two I used had red cords that weren't quite straight down but did reach the floor. There were plenty of rails All very helpful. It was easy to spend 5 hours there, learning a lot and enjoying all the interactive games, screens and explanations. Glasgow Science Centre A fun day out for Disabled Access Day!. I went along to the Glasgow Science Centre for Disabled Access Day 2019. When I first arrived I wasn't sure if the event was still on as the signage wasn't evident, but - after waiting in the queue and asking the man behind reception, I found out it was. Overa Reasonably easy to access via public transport (either by bus or by train into Exhibition Centre). Finding the door in is a bit of an issue, but once you find it you're fine. Easy to get into and no steps to trip over. I was with a wheelchair user and he found it relatively easy too. The lift isn't very easy to find as its camouflaged into the wall design, both of us walked straight past it. But once we knew where it was, it was great - my wheelchair user friend reckoned Whilst the toilets themselves were nice, clean and spacious, they were hard to find. No clear signage could be seen by us. But there are accessible toilets within easy reach of the lifts and the red cords hang to the floor. Very helpful and knowledgable. Whilst this was an 'access all areas' event for Disabled Access Day, the distinct lack of Disabled Access Day signage and advertising was noticeable by its absence. If i'd have been on my own, and not with a sighted friend, I wouldn't have went up to reception to ask as I would've thought I'd got th Glasgow Science Centre Access all areas day. A fun day with a variety of ways to get access to the full building. The staff were lovely and friendly. There was a lot of interactive activities. The Flame on fire show was exciting and worth a visit. Good instructions from staff about queuing up early. Using both public transport and driving to get to this venue was great with no issues. There are two lifts, it’s spacious and although it was a busy day it did not feel claustrophobic. It is very airy due to its layout and design. 
On entering the building there was a screen with bsl welcome and instructions. There was plenty of seating to take a rest and areas to go for some time aw They were on every floor but they were a bit untidy. The staff were outstanding and went out there way to make our visit as enjoyable as possible. They were also very informative and gave good advice. The staff were friendly and approachable.
They gave us maps at the beginning which helped us plan our visit. It was interesting, informative and we would certainly consider revisiting.  Our visit was particularly positive due to staff interaction. Glasgow Science Centre Learning can be fun!. A wheelchair accessible building with activity based experience that all the family can share Car park shared with other buildings but disabled parking is closest to the Science Centre building.  A considerable walk from car park to entrance if you are using sticks.
We did not know but we're told by staff that our parking ticket was put through a machine which cancels out the fee. Therefore Excellent with reasonable signage of lifts and loos. Seats on the main floors easily accessible . Did not use Very helpful, gave free entry for disabled person and half price to carer. Offered use of wheelchair, which was very useful as it's a huge space to negotiate. A few exhibits were grouped too close together to manage wheelchair easily Glasgow Science Centre A day out at the Science Centre. Such a great day out for the whole family. There plenty to do for both the small and big kids!! Great access throughout and plenty of accessible parking bays too. There are lots of Disabled parking bays available in the car park. I haven't visited using public transport. Great access which I found very easy to negotiate, but others might struggle slightly to get up the ramp at front door. There are lots of places to sit down around the centre, for those tiring on their feet. There are two lifts in the centre which go to all floors, but the small lift doesn't leave m The loo has everything you could ask for, but unfortunately it isn't a changing places loo. We were greeted warmly at the front door and were very impressed with the staff throughout our visit. It can seem a little pricey, but if you get the annual season pass it is extremely good value for money. Give yourself as much time as possible to get around, because there is so much to do! Glasgow Science Centre Glasgow science centre. Great place for a day out and very accessible      Glasgow Science Centre The Glasgow Science Centre. Lots of space, big lift but the toilet I used was a bit small for a wheel chair user. You have to pay for the parking. Details are on their web page. Some of the experiments require the need to be standing. There are moveable chairs/stools for sitting in front of all the sitting experiments that can be ""nudged"" out the way. As stated before the toilet that I used was a bit tight for space with a wheel chair. One of the others may be a bit bigger but I never had cause to look at them. There seemed ample staff there and they were very friendly and accessible. This, I feel, is more aimed at the younger more mobile people I can imagine it would be fun to watch your little ones enjoying doing, playing, the experiments and there are lots of them to do. The results of some of the experiments can be saved on a card that is there for you by scanning them and lo"
SEC - Scottish Event Campus,"SEC - Scottish Event Campus Large event access. I visited for Glasgow ACME comic con but I've been here many times. Overall Access is really great.

I borrowed a self propelled wheelchair from the venue as well as a sensory pack.

Overall it was really great the wheelchair I borrowed was a bit heavy to man I got there via train it's a pretty long walk to the venue so I don't recommend unless your driving.     SEC - Scottish Event Campus Hall 3 access review for concert. I went in to this one blind as there was no information online about the access here. To my knowledge there is no parking, very easy building to access however, accessible toilets using radar key. Not an ideal venue for people with physical disabilities,  it is prob This was my first time visiting the SEC, I’m a regular at the Hydro though so knew the parking at the venue wasn’t great. We parked across at The Village Hotel where we also went for tea (see separate review). This is a long walk if you have mobility problems, but in my powerchair it was smooth and  We approached staff at the entrance to the SEC and were let through the end door (with the disabled access tickets you don’t need to wait in line). The security guy at the door was super friendly and jovial, a good start! Getting in was easy with level access throughout. We looked for hall 3 but cou I couldn’t see any signage for the toilets but saw one across from hall 3 (so there are none in the hall itself). The toilet was accessed by radar key, the room was long but slim, with just enough space to turn. The sink was low, mirror was too high up, it had grab rails, was tidy, there was space f The staff were lacking at this event. The door staff to the building were great but at hall 3 they were actually quite rude. The person at the door had abruptly told I wasn’t allowed to bring the juice I’d just bought (bars and shops are next to hall 3) after discussing my needs another member of st Of course it’s great that there’s a disabled platform that allows wheelchair users to attend gigs in hall 3, but putting it right at the side of the room means we have a very poor view. A better place would be along the back of the room, this way we could see the stage and feel part of the gig and t SEC - Scottish Event Campus Ideal Homes. Once in the venue the access s pretty good however parking and access to the venue is poor.  The multi storey carpark was easy to find however it was not well signed to the disabled spaces on the 2d floor.   Once found I  found the only space left had limited space as someone had parked not very well signed  Dissabled parking on Floor 2 as I recognised building and had been there before I didn't rely on it. within the venue there are wheelchair accessible toilets which require Radar Key to access.  the key is available from a reception desk.   The toilet is large enough to accommodate a chair and has grab and drop rail.   there is an alarm chord which hung vertically to near ground.    There is a suita  Accessibility within the show was quite limited as show house and caravans and several exhibits were not accessible being on raised plinths or having stairs.  The upside however was the food and drink show where most of traders and resources were accessible from chair.

Great event its a shame its only on once a year Massive car park if the one at the back and plenty of spaces, for the disabled and the main stream this venue is totally accessible I dont know about the disabled but the main stream once were fine Staff were really good Please come along next year Euan Guide as Ryan was great at the stall this week SEC - Scottish Event Campus Ignition Festival of Motoring. An expansive, exciting and interesting event with something for everyone. Superbly organised with very friendly and helpful staff. We drove to the event and parked in the SEC multi-storey car park adjacent to the venue. There are several levels to the car park, all with lots of disabled spaces located next to the ticket machines and lifts. The lifts were spacious and quick. 
There is a short walkway from the car park to the ve There were several different areas of the event, all on ground level with no steps. There were only a few doors and they are all automatic. 
The event was very busy but all walkways were wide with plenty of room for wheelchairs and other mobility aids.
 
All restaurants and cafes had disabled acc There was a spacious disabled toilet located in the centre of the main concourse of the SEC. It and grab rails and was big enough to manoeuvre. There was room for a cater to accompany. 
There was only one disabled toilet which may have resulted in a bit of a wait at times as the event was very busy The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a great event, suitable for all ages and with something for everyone. I'd highly recommend it. SEC - Scottish Event Campus Free for all!. Not impressed!!! Utter free for all coming into venue. No support to get to disabled platform. Fair distance to walk thru the free for all crowds. No specified access for disabled patrons. Disabled platform only good thing . Staff seemed to have scant knowledge of how to support disab Pricy but good Chaotic!! Wheelchair accessible but no pathway to get to seating platform, hence I had to fight thru crowds. Again free for all. Non disabled folk using it and staff did nothing to stop them. Limited disabled training it seems. 
They point and give general information.  Nothing more than that tho ... Love the hydro and armadillo.  Excellent staff and facilities there. Unlike the SECC SEC - Scottish Event Campus Exhibition space ...Good level access, parking, accessible toilets, and plenty of space. Dedicated parking spaces for Blue Badge holders. Good overall accessibility. Several accessible toilets. Helpful staff. Dedicated railway station nearby, buses stop outside, and on site parking."
Buchanan Galleries,"Easy to access, spacious, good mix of retail and F&B, doors can be quite heavy to open, overall good centre I visited this place with some friends and a security staff helped us to find Boots the chemist. I also enyoed time in Greegs. It is a little bit confusing the number of floors. I went there for a Mozart concert. I saw many old age folks but to my surprise I couldn't find any accessible ways.  Buchanan Galleries Accessible shopping with plenty of food choices. Multiple floors of accessible shops, including my favourite: a Lego store! On the 2nd floor, there are restaurants and well thought out accessible toilets. Nearby the bus station and close to Queens Street train station. Level access and lifts to all floors Well thought through   Buchanan Galleries Very Accessible. Buchanan Galleries has many wheelchair friendly access points throughout the building with automatic doors for easy access. This shopping centre has an accessible multi-storey car park. There are both disabled and wider car parking spaces. Buchanan Galleries is a ten minute walk away from Glasgow Central Station and five minutes away from Buchanan Bus Station so again it is very easily accessed. In this centre there are various disabled friendly entrances. The shops are all easily accessed as there is no need for stairs or a lift on the ground floor.  To get to the upper floors a lift is required, and all lifts are well sign posted and easily accessed  Staff are all very nice and willing to help. I would highly recommend Buchanan Galleries. Buchanan Galleries Accessibility. The shopping centre is very accessible to all with both automatic and manual doors and no steps into any shops which is crucial for wheelchair users.  I thought disabled access was useful as there are automatic doors available however I do think there could be more than two and they could maybe be slightly wider so wheelchairs can get through confidently. All the shops were easy to access due to no stairs and lifts were available to upper floors.  Very friendly and willing to help.  Buchanan Galleries Buchanan Galleries Access Review. The building had many access points and the shops were all easily accessible as no stairs were required to enter them. The building had a car park which was located in John Lewis store however it cost £25 floor 24 hours which could be extensive if you are living of benefits. It is located a 5 minute walk away from Buchanan bus station which offers easy access of and on the buses. The building offered many disability accessible opportunities. This was due to the automatic doors found at the entrances which enables wheelchairs to pass through with ease however we felt it would be nice to see just one other automatic door at both entrances, creating two for each entrance, to en  All friendly and willing to help.  Buchanan Galleries Accessible for All. My friend and I visited Buchanan Galleries in Glasgow to assess its suitability for anyone with mobility problems. We came to the conclusion that Buchanan Galleries has a variety of different features in place which aid people who have a physical disability.  Buchanan Galleries has two entrances that are suitable for people who are in wheelchairs. The first entrance is a steady slope nearest John Lewis in the shopping centre. This entrance has a variety of wide doors which allows access for people in wheelchairs. However these doors are not automatic mea There is access to disabled toilets on the ground floor, first floor and second floor of Buchanan Galleries. These toilets are fitted with hand rails and emergency aids. The doors to the toilet are wide, allowing access for wheelchairs and other necessities. For access to the disabled toilet, you mu All staff are approachable and friendly. There is an information desk located on the first floor of the shopping centre beside John Lewis.  Buchanan Galleries Buchanan Gallaries. This is a large shopping centre there are two street entrances one on Buchanan St the other on Sauchiehall St both have automatic doors which is of benefit to everyone using the centre.
Information boards giving the layout of the centre are at both entrances. There is a large multi story car park attached to the centre you can access the centre directly from the car park. The access point to the car park is on North Hanover St. 
Buchanan St Bus station is a good 10 minutes walk a way as is Queen St Train Station. Over all the access is good however the door in from the Street on Buchanan St is on a hill this is due to the street its self and has some steps. If you can make it to the top of the hill and on to Bath St it is level there to access the doors.
Of course the layout of each store is  very different There are 3 wheelchair accessible toilets two of these are accessible by using a Radar key if you have one however security staff in the centre also have keys. 
The 3 toilet is on the top floor area this is the food court this toilet is next to the rest of the toilets for the centre. The wheelchair There is a large number of staff employed in the centre however the staff my self and my wife spoke to were very helpful.
As we entered by the Sauchiehall St door we stopped to  read the information board with in a minute of doing so one of the security staff asked if we needed any help. A while la The entrance on Buchanan St is in the lower level of the centre and there are not many shops in this area. It is also the only area that does not have an accessible toilet in the centre Buchanan Galleries A shopping stop ...Access to the Galleries was level and an automated door was helpful. The Galleries have their own car park. Disabled access was generally good. When coming in from the surrounding streets there is more than one entrance and not all appear accessible.

Some areas of the ground floor concourse were not level and had a slight gradient. This may be a problem for some people. Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor as well as the first and second floors. Access to these is via a RADAR key or by asking at the information desk. The accessible toilet on the ground floor (we used this one) was spacious, bright and clean with all the expected features. Staff were helpful and when asked where things were gave clear and accurate directions. A good choice of shops all under one roof."
Glasgow Airport,"Decent shopping, cafés & restaurants in the departure lounge after security. The main terminal building looks a bit dated and the toilets are not pleasant.   Major airport for travelling in and out of Scotland. Easily accessible.  I haven’t carried out a review  My family and I found the Glasgow Airport is easily accessible when it comes to visual. It has clear signage and wayfinding. At times it could get really crowded and perhaps something could be done by airport management to improve the situation with the crowd and dissemination of information especially. Despite that we find in terms of accessibility it is well designed for.  I had an overall very good experience at Glasgow airport a couple of years ago. We had booked priority boarding as I am visually impaired, and this was all very well organised. We were allowed to skip long queues as well. Glasgow Airport a good accessible airport. I fly from Glasgow airport every year and it  is a sure airport to fly from! always get  a taxi there.  the taxi drop off bit is in the inside car  park  and then there is just a wee walk over in to the airport. the airport is very accessible. it is all  flat inside and outside.  there is big lifts.   restaurants and shops are   roomly there is a changing places toilet which it is fantastic but it is where  the check in but it will be great if there is a changing places at the gates side the  staff is all nice and helpful from check in Right through to getting on the  airplane.  Glasgow Airport A mixed experience. This was my first time visiting Glasgow airport as a wheelchair user. It was a very mixed experience with the assistance point being really helpful and friendly along with the staff who took me through security and to the plane. Less good was the changing place toilet was very di The transport options are fairly good. There is a phone at the drop off area to the assistance people so you can request assistance immediately from the drop off point if needed. There are also a lot of wheelchair airport taxis out the front too. On the whole disabled access was great. There are lifts between floors and I was able to stay in my wheelchair through security. To get on to the plane I used a lift that is on the back of a lorry to get to the plane door and an aisle seat to my chair. The staff were all brilliant throughout this an It was fantastic to see a changing place toilet near the check in desks. Unfortunately it was quite hard to find and I had to be shown where to go so much signage would be great. When I went in it was pretty dirty and could have done with a clean, which isn’t great during Covid either. The other dis The assistance staff were fantastic. Despite obviously being short staffed and incredibly busy they remained friendly and helpful and were very chatty while going through security and to my gate. There was no problem with them either taking me to fill up my water bottles past security. The staff who Staff all wore masks and followed covid guidance. As I had a lanyard on showing I was more vulnerable to Covid the assistance staff didn’t take me through the normal security queue but to a quieter line to make it safer. There were though lots of people not following Covid guidance and not much hand Glasgow Airport Airport and Facilities. This is a follow up review from our last visit to Glasgow Airport in May 2018. The biggest change to the airport since our last visit in May for me has to be the ""New"" ""CHANGING PLACES TOILET"". I found that just having a toilet that I could use was great comfort just knowing  We didn't use the parking so can't comment on the parking.

We have used both taxi (wheelchair accessible vehicle ""WAV"") and the 500 bus to get into Glasgow City Center both very power wheelchair friendly. Both available outside the main entrance. Access for me as a power wheelchair user was first class. If there were steps you had a ramp or a lift to get me where we wanted to go. Plenty of signage so we always knew where we were going. This was the biggest improvement for me to see a new Changing Places Toilet at the airport. The beauty about the new toilet, it's situated just inside the main entrance door so visitors meeting friends or family can use it too. The OCS PRM team you could not ask for friendlier people and their knowledge of the Eagle Lifter is second to ""NONE"".

Glasgow Airport OCS PRM Service. The OCS team at GLA were fantastic, the Eagle Lifter is only new at the airport. The team who came to take me off the Easyjet flight on arrival at the airport were first class. I was taken out of my seat and in my wheelchair in the ambulift within minutes. Even though it all went fa No need for parking. The airport is very easy to get around, lots of signage and very wheelchair friendly. The toilet we went into just to empty my leg bag before we got on the flight was very small. The toilet was very easy to find but with a power chair like mine the room was very small. The toilet had all the correct items a disabled toilet needs and very clean, but for a person like me who needs hois Every staff member we had dealings with were very friendly and polite. My tool kit for the wheelchair got pulled at security as it always does but once the reason for the tool kit was explained they let it through. Would highly recommend the airport to any wheelchair user but the only thing I would say is to ask about the toilet if you need hoisting. I prepare myself so I don't need toileting the day of a flight. Glasgow Airport Some mistakes make it difficult to access. When we checked in we were asked if Mum could make it up the plane steps, but they failed to tell us that we'd need to go down two flights to go back to! This was too much and we had to navigate back through the crowd to find a lift to take us to another (e We parked at NCP long stay (nearest the airport) and had to get bus etc. See main review re gate access The disabled toilets in the departure lounge are accessed through a pub. While there is a walkway through, there are chairs and bags blocking the way. Generally people are helpful but having to go through asking people to move is not good. Most were helpful and friendly.  Glasgow Airport Needs improved for a major airport!. Mixture of good and bad experience. Staff in check in fantastic and helpful, airline allowed me to take my own wheelchair right to the door of the plane , and placed my fold away walking frame in the hold.

Hampden Park Stadium,"Hampden Park Stadium Shame on You Hampden Stadium. My sister has poor mobility and we were given Christmas gifts of tickets to see P!Nk at a national stadium - when we enquired about a lift to our floor not one of the staff members knew where the lift was. My sister had to practically crawl and haul herself to her seat. My sister had carried out research and there was restricted parking there was 35 disability spaces ridiculous Terrible None Staff were hired in and although nice enough they didn’t have a clue Nearly spoiled our night Hampden Park Stadium Visiting for a concert rather than a football game. My experience of Hampden Stadium was brilliant. I attended the Ed Sheeran concert and from the moment I arrived everything was simple. There was blue badge parking and entrance to the stadium via tunnel straight onto the pitch area. There was a pla There is blue badge parking at the stadium and there was a very large section held back for blue badge holders. Access was simple, through a tunnel and straight onto the pitch. The reporter lives right next to the accessible platform. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend going to a concert at the stadium, I felt very welcome and all my questions were answered by the very helpful staff. Hampden Park Stadium Coldplay Gig. Great gig, toilets to small. Got parked at venue near entrance, traffic terrible on exit Easy access to viewing platform, great view of stage. However ramp was steep To small for me and carer, it was a portoloo. Hard if you have large chair Excellent very helpful To many people on platform who didn't need to be on it some disabled people had 4 people with them should be limited to two people with them as some people need two carers.

Just a shame that they lost! Couldn't fault it! We were very apprehensive beforehand as hadn't travelled that route on a match day before. We went via Glasgow Central and then Mount Florida. Helpful staff at each point.

No one particularly helpful but seemed to work well and there weren't any problems... Would go back! Overall great experience. Hampden Park Stadium Toilets too small. I used the toilets at the stadium and felt that the disabled toilet was not big enough for me and wheelchair to move around in. I felt that the disabled transport system for the games could have been planned better for the disabled visitors . Access was excellent The toilets were to small for wheelchairs Staff were fantastic both in and out of the venue  Hampden Park Stadium Great night left with sour taste. Yet again my major gripe with the commonwealth games so far at any venue I've been to has to be the signage to the accessible parking. Once there and in the stadium, our seats were at the top of the stand and had an excellent view of the athletics. Terrible experience at the shields road accessible transport pick up. Getting there was an effort with terrible signage. Eventually seen a sign saying second left, so took it, only to go down it and get sent back as that was the exit. Had to go out onto main road again and in entrance only to find I In the venue was fantastic, on the way to the venue from the shuttle bus stop, at times was difficult finding a dropped kerb. At the part of the stadium I was located was porta loos which were kept very clean and were spaciously designed inside. All the staff were again very friendly and helpful with the exception of the parking attendants at shields road accessible car park. Going out I was trying to get to the accessible bus area but with the flow of people could not cross the people moving. This was not helped by an aggressive sounding steward shouting at people to keep moving.  He could've stopped them to let me cross over. A helpful thing could be a wheelchair/disab Hampden Park Stadium Easily accessible, but toilets not big enough. Great parking, easily accessible, toilets not big enough  Easily accessible. Not big enough, was a very tight squeeze , disabled toilets need to be bigger taking into account different sized wheelchairs (some motorised ones much longer than standard ). Every time a goal was scored the security staff and police stood side by side making a barrier at the side of pitch right in front of wheelchair users causing them to block their view. I know this was a security measure bit very unfair to wheelchair users. "
Tollcross International Swimming Centre,"Tollcross International Swimming Centre brilliant venue. This venue is brilliant they have done it up recently and its brilliant location

Tollcross International Swimming Centre is a very accessible and friendly sports centre that caters to all. Ample parking spaces including Disabled and Family designated spaces.
Nearest bus stop is a short walk away. Very accessible. 
Centre has a hearing loop system and is guide dog friendly. 
Well signposted. 
Plenty of spaces to rest or catch your breath. Toilets within the complex are well sign posted and easy to find.
Disabled toilets have enough room to manoeuvre, are very clean and have grab rails to provide support. Staff are exceptionally helpful. I would definitely recommend Tollcross International Swimming Centre and will be returning with my partner. Tollcross International Swimming Centre Tollcross Swimming Centre. Hard to rate higher as seating area which would include wheelchair areas not yet installed. CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient. Overall access appeared to be very good. Was not able to view on the day. Staff me were very upbeat and keen to ensure disabled customers were looked up. I am still not convinced sightlines for wheelchair users will allow view of pool edge. Tollcross International Swimming Centre Good wheelchair seating with good views. Access at front very good. Access to changing & swimming is excellent! Car park quite small. Several blue badge bays. Pool pods! Sound amazing!! :-)
Very spacious changing room - fab! Automatic doors The bathroom is very big and spacious. All the equipment you need. Very nice & helpful. Some signs are small and hard to see. 
Huge wet room - Quite Impressive!! Tollcross International Swimming Centre Splish, spash, splosh!. A great venue where a lot of planning and thought has obviously gone into providing an accessible experience for disabled visitors. Parking for disabled visitors right outside the front door! Accessible buses pass along the nearby road and will take you into the city centre. You can park in designated Blue Badge bays outside the front door. The main entrance doors, as well as many internal doors, are automated. Areas of the complex are well signposted and there are spacious accessible changing areas, accessible loos, and the ""pod"" swimming pool access system is being in There's one of the best wet rooms and loo that I've ever seen. It's set out in a similar style to the Changing Places loos complete with hoist and changing facilties; as well as a shower. On our visit we managed to get five wheelchair users in the room at the same time to take a look!

Other acces Staff were very knowledgable about the requirements that disabled people may have in order to enjoy swimming or taking part as a spectator. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and they made the visit more enjoyable and were happy to answer questions and help where they could. Well done! One of the most thought out swimming facilities I have ever seen. So much so it becomes an attractive propostiion to make a repeat visit. The detail and thought into how to assist disabled swimmers was outstanding. Tollcross International Swimming Centre Tollcross is on another level!!. From the pavement to the pool, Tollcross was a breath of fresh air in terms of access. Plenty of disabled bays right along the front of the centre with lowered kerbside. Level access from the car all the way through the changing rooms and into the pool! Wide automatic doors at the front entrance leading to a spacious reception area, top marks. The accessible toilet I was shown was the best I have seen in any venue, anywhere in the world. At one point there were 6 wheelchair users and 3 others in the toilet and there was still plenty of space! We were shown around by a member of the Glasgow 2014 organising committee and the centre manager. They were both very knowledgeable and very accommodating. Staff overall were great. During the Commonwealth games Tollcross will host the swimming event. The accessible shuttle drops off in Wellshot primary school 50 yards away. Can't get much better than that."
CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar,"CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar Great access. Visited Saramamgo cafe for lunch with friends. Staff were very helpful at moving tables and fitting us all in. Table height could have been better but problem was solved by elevating my plate on top of a bowl. 
Great food, great books and exhibitions. Lift to other levels. Well worth  Had to park several blocks away. There's nowhere to park near there and it's a long walk from train stations or underground. I think there are buses that stop nearby but not good for getting there unless you walk or cycle. Very good level access and lift access, helpful staff but need an automatic door. Tight for space but accessible for most wheelchairs. No changing place or anything like that. Very helpful friendly staff  CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar Cool amazing building with access in mind. This is an amazing building that I always wanted to visit, it always has really interesting shows advertised and the shop window always looked interesting. Our hotel was round the corner and it was the perfect opportunity to check it out. 

I was really g Good public transport routes on Sauchiehall Street, Charring Cross Station is about a 5 minute walk away. The building has great access, the bar area is wide and was playing Belle and Sebastian, which is always a good thing! I didn't go upstairs, but there is a lift. Clean, wide and plenty of space in the accessible loo. They were very cheerful, helpful and provided useful information when required. We came early morning but this would be a great place to come in the late evening as they bar had great choices! CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar A wee coffee break. Great Atmosphere. Has level access from the street and accessible bathroom with clear sign posting. On street parking, but didn't see any designated disabled parking close by Very accessible with level access to the cafe and bathroom. Only downside is no automatic entrance door which needs to be pulled open towards you Clean and accessible, but is quite cramped. Very nice and friendly Lots of events on through the year! CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar Great cafe and arts space. Generally easy to get around as a wheelchair user. Are accessible loos on each floor (although the one on the top floor is quite tight. The cafe is fantastic. Probably tricky to park nearby  other than some on street parking.  Plenty buses stop nearby. Excellent other than the heavy doors in places. Front door is a bit heavy to manage on your own, and there are some fire doors upstairs that are heavy too. There is one on each floor. Best on is the one at the back of the cafe (on the left, second loo). Very helpful  CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar Coffee, lunch, meetings and arts. Getting into the building from the street was fairly easy. There are two doors which are wide enough and have level access.

I used one adjacent to the cafe area. It was spacious and served its purpose; although I did find the doors tricky to manage. Staff were friendly and helpful.  CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts & Saramago Cafe Bar Fantastic Vegan Cafe. Delicious vegan menu, with all bread baked in house. Worked well for us access wise (I was with a friend who is a powerchair user). Tables and chairs are moveable, staff are very friendly and there is a good accessible loo at the back of the cafe, by the bar. Looking forward to We came from Queen Street station, up the pedestrian area of Buchanan St and Sauchiehall Street  (has much much better pavement than any other route!) 

Parking might be a challenge as I think you might need to park on a side street, some of which are on a big slope! See before. 
Only improvement I'd suggest would be for the doors of the CCA to be automated, or for a bell at the door for assistance as they are pretty heavy. Good accessible loo at the back of the cafe. There are others on other floors of the CCA too.  The CCA is pretty great too"
Crowne Plaza,"Crowne Plaza Things Are Changing For The Worst. Unfortunately the accessibility features that are available for staying at The Crowne Plaza isn't the same as it used to be and means I probably won't be able to stay for a while. There are plenty of accessible parking spaces within the car park of The Crowne Plaza at the back entrance however, it is a long walk from the car park to the reception through a corridor. It's £7 each night to park here, don't forget to say to reception when you check in or you could get a parking  So the 'accessible' rooms are the main features that have changed at The Crowne Plaza. A week before our visit we got told that the room with the ceiling hoist was no longer available due to fire safety however, when we arrived the new accessible rooms weren't suitable for our needs and we got moved I didn't use any of the public toilets in the hotel so I cannot comment on them.

I didn’t see the bathrooms in the new ‘accessible’ rooms in person but, it was included in the video I saw. Like me if you are unable to get into a bath then the bathroom in the new ‘accessible’ room is not accessible  Everytime I have stayed at The Crowne Plaza all staff have been extremely friendly and helpful. When we spoke to 2 of the managers about the issues we had during our stay, they seemed to take what we said on board, we'll just see if things change for the better. I'm looking forward to them hopefully getting a ceiling hoist in their new accessible rooms as I did enjoy staying at The Crowne Plaza. Crowne Plaza Brilliant Event Venue.

Great wheelchair accessible hotel near the city centre of Glasgow. There are over 5 disabled parking spaces round the back of the hotel in the hotel car park as well as many more non-disabled spaces in close proximity. You pay £6 for the car park per day of you staying at the hotel. The taxi rank for the hotel is right at the front door with plenty of space to have The back entrance from the car park is level access with automatic doors, however it is quite a distance to walk from the car park to the main area of the hotel. Therefore, some people may want to get dropped off at the main entrance. The door at the main entrance is a swivel door however, there is  I didn’t have a look at the public toilet within the hotel, so I cannot comment on it. 

The toilet in the accessible room was quite narrow however, I was very surprised there was a tracking hoist in it. Although you have to dismount the hoist machine from the tracking in the bedroom and connect i All staff that I encountered during my stay were very nice and always spoke to me instead of my helper which is a big positive in my eyes. When we checked into the hotel the steward helped us with our bags to the room and explained the fire safety procedures and asked if we needed any help with the  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that has to use a hoist to transfer like myself. There aren’t many hotel rooms out there that provide this equipment or are built for it. Although it would be difficult for somebody to transfer to the shower, so this needs to be looked at, but having Crowne Plaza Wonderful accessible Hotel. The fully accessible room on the upper floor is fantastic with amazing views.  It's a pleasure to stay in a normal looking, luxurious room which is completely accessible.  Staff here are exceptionally understanding, very kind and thoughtful  and most accommodating. Great  Disabled parking is right outside the side door of the hotel in designated slots. Taxis can pull up outside the front door. The metro train from Glasgow Central is a short walk which may be too far for a wheelchair user with luggage. All areas of the hotel are step free with ramps to lower levels in the restaurant. There were several lifts and all accommodated a fairly large power chair.  All staff were excellent and most helpful especially in the restaurant. The Head Housekeeper introduced herself to us personally and offered any help we might need.

Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox,"Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox Beautiful Converted Church makes for a fantastic gig atmosphere.(Wheelchair User)
My sister and I went to see Lucky Chops at this venue in October 2022.
We arrived early, We were greeted and welcomed by staff from the start.  
I had previously been advised to call ahead the week before the gig to bo We were able to get a blue badge spot right outside the venue. There were plenty of parking spaces as it is situated across from the Barrowlands. There are two access points for those with wheelchairs, There is a door which leads to the restaurant which has a wheelchair lift or if you speak with staff there is a direct access door around the side of the building which they will open for you. I did see the accessible toilet that was opposite the wheelchair lift in the foyer of the venue, but I never used it this visit so can not review the functionality. The staff were amazing and very informative, we were shown to the accessible area where our seat and wheelchair space had been assigned to us. During the course of the gig, they would periodically check on us. 
Such a lovely atmosphere and pleasant vibe from all staff and managers really made you f  Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox A friendly Celtic Connections gig. Round from the corner from the Barrowlands this much more accessible venue is the place to see a gig in Glasgow. I've been here a few times before and really have had a brilliant experience.

We went for some chips and a wee drink in the bar before, it was really We walked about 20 minutes from Glasgow queen street station, but that was by choice.

I've got an taxi right up to the front once. Access is good as mentioned before.

A ramp could be more practical than the complicated electric lift. Great spacious clean accessible toilet. Red chord tie was not freely hanging. It’s on the ground level next to bar, it’s not too obvious that it's an accessible toilet, maybe larger sign? Very friendy, helpful and listened to me Normally upstairs is open, this time it wasn't and it’s nice to get a seat up there, if you are able to get up there. 

Some seats where downstairs but it was a free for all and I really would had liked a seat. Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox Beautiful venue. Situated in a converted church, the venue has kept some of the original features, such as the organ pipes. There are a handful of steps to the concert hall and a thoughtfully positioned lift to carry wheelchairs and the less mobile up the short distance, staff are with you when the  On street parking Level access into the venue and a lift to the concert hall Situation near the entrance Thoughtful and considerate  Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox Skateboard evening.

St Lukes is a restored church that now serves as a top bar/restaurant and music venue. It is located in the Gallowgate area of Glasgow. 

Serving quality food, this venue is wheelchair accessible* and dog friendly. 

*Although easily accessed by wheelchair, maneuvering inside  This venue is centrally located and so parking facilities are limited in general. There is a side street where it is possible to park, including spots specifically for disabled parking. Access from the side street and the main road is possible by wheelchair.

Bellgrove train station is the closest The main entrance to the bar and restaurant is easily accessible by wheelchair. From here it is possible to gain entry to the venue through side doors or using a lift to navigate the few steps at the main venue entrance.

The bar/restaurant could become difficult to navigate for wheelchair users a Spacious disabled toilet available. Staff were generally pleasant and helpful with questions or requests.  Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox St Luke's and the Winged Ox. Quirky-cool concert and event venue with a decent restaurant and good wheelchair access. There are two disabled bays right outside the venue plus other on-street parking options. Taxis can drop off outside the venue, there's just a short push over a paved area to get to the venue. Public transport doesn't go past but it's near the Gallowgate, so you could get a bus to there. Access was generally very good. The venue is approached across a large slabbed area, which is easy to wheel across. The disabled entrance to the venue is to the right, as the main door is via steps. Once into the venue there's a platform lift that takes you to the concert hall, with swing doors to g The accessible loo was fine, a nice large room, clean and well laid out, with a red cord all the way to the floor. Shame the bin was pedal operated, though! Also the loo is on the ground floor level while the concert hall is on the first floor. Bouncers were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Opened doors, directed us to the concert hall and also operated the platform lift for us. Would be very happy to visit St Luke's again. Overall, a positive experience. That the restaurant is dog-friendly is also a bonus!"
City Halls/Old Fruitmarket,"City Halls/Old Fruitmarket great venue. The Merchant city area in general but especially the city halls has stunning architecture. I was here before for a Celtic Connections concert which was fantastic. This time it was at a conference I was attending with the GDA [Glasgow disability alliance]. I traveled in a taxi to this event, you can be dropped off immediately outside
Queen Street, High Street and Argyle Street train stations are within walking distance. 
There are regular buses on the Trongate and Glassford Street which are nearby the venue.
There is an NCP car park on Ingram Stree I entered the building via the Candleriggs, this entrance has automatic doors. Because I was attending the event with the GDA I had had plenty of assistance. There was also plenty of venue staff on hand so I had no problem with the internal doors. the toilet had bi-folding door which is excellent for saving space. The toilet was clean and tidy. Because I was here with the GDA I didn’t have much interaction with staff. The venue staff I met seemed friendly and helpful. It's a great building. The old fruit market has a nostalgic feel. I will need to get back here for the Celtic connections next year City Halls/Old Fruitmarket Stunning venue but access could be better. A stunning venue with original features and good wheelchair access, but balcony view from accessible area is poor. We found nearby on-street parking and used our disabled blue badge. The location is quite handy if arriving by train with Glasgow Queen Street station only a 10 minute walk away and Central Station around 10 – 15-minute walk. There is an NCP on Ingram Street which is right at the venue. The car park Easy and step-free access into the venue. Staff then escorted us to the lift and up to the accessible balcony area. At least two wheelchairs and several companions can fit in the lift as it is quite spacious.

The accessible balcony area is at the back of the room close to the accessible toilet. A The accessible toilet is close to the balcony area. The toilet doesn't have a RADAR lock which would be good because as I went to use it I saw five girls all go into the accessible toilet at the same time because there was a small queue for the ladies toilets. I ended up having to leave without usin Staff were helpful and friendly  City Halls/Old Fruitmarket Another great gig at Celtic Connections. It was fabulous to be part of the audience for the BBC Radio Scotland young Traditional Musician of the year 2019!  The show featured six phenomenal finalists in this traditional Scottish music competition. 

The Glasgow City Halls is a great venue with lot I would normally travel up to Glasgow by train however as there was disruption on the railway I drove up by car with the help of my Mum. We parked in the St Enoch Centre car park which was ideal as it is open air and so no height restriction. Only thing is you have to have the right change availabil Heavy manual doors make access thoughout the building difficult without help. The doors within the corridors are magnetic and so will stay open by themselves unless the fire alarm goes off. The lift to take yo between floors is excellent as it is huge inside. Toilets are accessible however the space within the toilet is very cramped 

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the emergency cord was hanging free to the floor. Well done city hall! Overall staff were pleasant and helpful the staff at the main entrance were slow to respond when we asked for help and directions as they were busy dealing with other customers. This was a great visit to a lovely venue and a fantastic night of entertainment. 

The one thing I will mention is that during the interval of a performance, there is a bell that rings along with an announcement asking the audience to return to their seats. This made me jump a few times as it soun City Halls/Old Fruitmarket Old Fruitmarket excellent concert venue. The character and ambience of the old market makes it a first class venue for a range of performances. Our last visit was to see the Mavericks as part ofCeltic Connections. For this, it was standing room only with accessible areas on balcony and seats provide      City Halls/Old Fruitmarket Great place for a gig. Stornoway's farewell tour was the gig I most wanted to see. Couldn't stand in main hall so phoned to ask about accessible area. Staff were very friendly, pleasant and told me about accessible area and arrangements. I turned up and it was even easier! Friendly staff pointed out A friend drove me and we parked close by. Good lift, lovely staff to meet and greet and show you to your seat. Huge area. We had the best seats in the house. Easy to get to. Very clean. Cannot rate the staff highly enough. Was daunted about attending the gig but I phoned and it all became easy and straightforward. City Halls/Old Fruitmarket Accessible venue in heart of Glasgow. Really impressed with the accessibility at the City Halls. From the entrance to the staff to the different lifts for different sections of the auditorium. Good signage too. It's near Glasgow Queen Street station so convenient to get to. Not sure where the nearest blue badge parking is nearby. Really good! From the step free entrance to the decent sized lifts (there's different lifts for different parts of the auditorium). There was also clear signage regarding the Hearing Loop. Clean, tidy and spacious. All the staff we met were very helpful! We were there for an event so did not access the auditorium so can't comment on that - but everything that we did see was great."
Gallery of Modern Art GoMA,"Gallery of Modern Art GoMA Visit to the GOMA on a rainy day. Visited the GOMA to hide from the rain and spent an hour rolling around taking in the modernism. Came on wheels so unsure about nearest public transport. There are blue badge bays around the area but you’ll need to be lucky especially on weekends. Great access built into a beautiful building - wheelchair access can be and is aesthetic! Lift goes to all floors and there are accessible toilets in basement level (cafe & library floor) and on the top level. There were seats around all exhibits and large print booklets available near the lifts and Not very big at all (see pics). In fine condition and no RADAR key required. There were red cords in both hanging low and already had Euan’s Guide cards on :) Did not speak to anyone but signs around implied they would be more than happy to help with reading labels, carrying things and getting wheelchairs if needed. Don’t forget to have a look at the Duke of Wellington statue with the cone on its head when you leave; classic Glaswegian attraction in itself! Gallery of Modern Art GoMA Not far off perfect!!. There is one entrance which has automatic doors and is accessible by stairs or a ramp. There are staff at the front desk and walking around so they can be easily reached. As you go in you can see signs explaining that they offer assisted evacuation to those who may need it and No parking available but many public transport options including bus, train and subway very near by. Entrance accessible by ramp or stairs. Lift inside. Signs mapping out venue and explaining how evacuation works for those who need assistance. Wheelchair hire at front desk. Introduction video using British Sign Lanuage and subtitles. There was an accessible toilet which included a baby changing table. It was spacious enough to manoeuvre or for a carer to be in there and there was hand rails. Could have been slightly cleaner was the only criticism. Staff at front desk as you enter so easy to find if you needed help. However, didn't go out their way to greet you or assist without prompting. Very positive experience here, pleasantly surprised at how well thought out the venue is in terms of accessibility. Gallery of Modern Art GoMA Gallery Of Modern Art. We found the the building easily access from ramps at the rear which led around the well maintained pavement to the access ramps at the front. The only lift there was subject to routine maintenance  at the time of our visit and there was not a second one available to reach the The venue was in the city centre so parking is limited but there is a bus stop just opposite the gallery and enough space to be dropped off by a euro taxi. There is parking in the St Enochs Centre which has disabled parking and lifts into the complex and then onto the street, to cross Argyle Street  We thought they would benefit from a second lift  as there is 4 stories of galleries and a basement cafe and library and today the one lift was being fixed. The toilets are also upstairs and in the basement so we really needed the lift They were not looked at today for the reason above. Everyone kind and polite. We will go another day Gallery of Modern Art GoMA Art for all. As a city centre gallery I wasn't sure what to expect. It was great to find an accessible gallery along with a shop, library and cafe. Being in the centre of Glasgow there were plenty of buses to choose from. Taxis were in abundance and it was a short walk to both Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central railway stations. Facing the building you see several steps to get in. Exploring closer I found a ramp on either side of the door. Going in through the automatic door staff welcomed us and gave us a map. An accessible lift, large enough for two wheelchairs, took us to the various levels. Once inside the gallery exhib An accessible toilet was adjacent to the standard toilets in the lower level. Access to this was on request as it was kept locked. It was spacious, had grab rails and was clean and tidy. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. At the lower level there was a cafe which was easy to wheel around and had moveable furniture which allowed for easy wheelchair access. It was good to find that it was easy to wheel around the shop without having to worry about hitting displays. All in all a great place to visit where our group, inc Gallery of Modern Art GoMA A work of Art. n the city centre, the gallery is housed in a beautiful building with good access.

Not much dealings with staff but when I did they were very helpful. The gallery had information booklets with large print for visually impaired.
Directly outside, there looked to be a number of restaurants and coffee shops that had level access and outside seating area although did not visit any of them. Gallery of Modern Art GoMA Art to ponder ...Access to the building was via ramps at the side of the main entrance. The building was easy to get around and well signposted. Very little parking opportunity as the Gallery is in the heart of the city. Disabled access was good although the entrance ramps not obvious to the casual visitor. A useful map was available, the galleries level access, with a lift providing the means to go between floors. An accessible toilet was available on the lower floor. Not the easiest to find. Staff were pleasant and helpful. A useful stop off to explore if you find yourself in Glasgow city centre."

There are a wide variety of buses available that go to places such as Edinburgh city and airport , Aberdeen and many more.

The Tall Ship Glenlee,"The Tall Ship Glenlee Sail away to the past on the Tall ship. The Tall ship is moored at the quayside of the riverside museum and is very accessible for everyone to see. There are lots of disabled parking spaces available at the front of the riverside museum. The ship has been ramped at both entrance and exit to make it more accessible to everyone. The steepness of the ramp depends understandably on the level of the tide. Some of the doorways are quite narrow but overall the ship is very accessible to everyone and an interesting piece of Glasgow history  The nearest accessible toilets are with the riverside museum which have handrails but no changing places toilets Staff are very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the visit and was surprised at how accessible the ship is. A visit to the riverside museum and Tall ship are both free. I hope you enjoy your visit as much as I did! The Tall Ship Glenlee Amazing access for such an old vessel. Very accessible. Even has an accessible loo via the poop deck. No pun intended. I visited via the Hop On Hop Off bus but plenty of parking if you go by car. Good gangways on and off the ship. Can be steep at high tide (9&5) when you may need someone to prevent you from couping. Lift to all decks. Be careful in the Poop, starboard side is level but there are four inch thresholds at other doors. For the age of the vessel they have done a great job with the toilet. Just basics of accessible toilet but well done. All staff were great A unique experience in the field of accessible attractions. The Tall Ship Glenlee Astonishingly accessible. What a treat to have a warm sunny Spring day on the Clyde. The Tall Ship is free to visit. The ramp up to the desk was easy and the deck quite roomy. The loveliest surprise was the floor below, which we accessed via the lift. It is roomy and flat, includes a great tea bar,  We came by train from Partick station, which is about 10 minutes walk but a nice walk. If you arrive by car, there is a drop-off point. I don't know about disabled parking. The 100 bus stops very close by. Ramp to the deck and lift to other floors. There are some spaces which are not accessible. The accessible loo is accessed via the lift and is fine except that the door lock didn't work. I reported that and am confident that it will be fixed asap. Friendly and welcoming. The Tall Ship looks very inaccessible and limited but is really easy to visit and well worth the time. The Tall Ship Glenlee Wonderfully accessible old ship!. Fantastic historical ship - surprisingly accessible - lots of thought has gone in to making it an inclusive place to visit. The Tall Ship is located by the Riverside Transport Museum. There is a large car park with Blue Badge parking spaces. There is a bus service to Glasgow City Centre. Absolutely brilliant! You get on to the ship by a gangway be aware that depending on the tide this can get quite steep! Once on board it's easy to navigate - there are boards up throughout that show how to get around and what is on each deck. Amazingly there is a decent size lift on board to get you Decent size accessible loo - clean and tidy. Has a Red Cord but this was tied up - otherwise would be 5*! Super helpful and knowledgeable! Well worth going to visit - right next door to the Riverside Transport Museum so make a day of it and visit both. Can also get to Glasgow City Centre by the cycle path if you are feeling active! The Tall Ship Glenlee All aboard ...Given that the tall ship was moored on the river and is a boat, access for me as a power chair user was excellent. Parking to visit the tall ship is via the Riverside Museum. As a result, it is quite some distance from the vehicle through the museum and out onto the quayside where the tall ship is  moored. The same would apply if arriving by Given the vessel is floating the access can be difficult at times according to the level of tide. There are two access ramps to board and embark. These can at times be set at a very steep angle and may make it difficult to get aboard. Once on board access was very good and a lift will take you to th The ship does have an accessible toilet but not having used it I can't comment further. Staff were present at the entrance point and at various points on the vessel. If you are willing and able to try boarding the vessel it's certainly worth it for the experience! Lots to see and explore and you can get a cup of tea in the onboard cafe!"

TRNSMT Festival,"TRNSMT Festival TRNSMT 2022. Accessible yearly 3 day weekend music festival with accessible viewing platforms for stages, accessible parking and a Changing Places toilet. When I previously visited TRNSMT in 2018 I got sent a PDF document through email beforehand including the accessibility information but this year I kept checking my emails and received nothing. All I saw was the map on the TRNSMT mobile app say the disabled parking was at the East entrance. I wasn't The queue to get into TRNSMT was very long when I arrived but I knew we had to go to the accessible booking office so I went past the queue and just headed in. There weren't any signs to point us in the direction of the accessible booking office but when I came up to certain areas staff would open b As you come into TRNSMT from the accessible booking office there are some accessible porta loos but I didn't go over to them. I did look at the accessible porta loos though at the accessible viewing platform, I'd say there around 10 of them, maybe a few more. They are a little small inside though an As I have mentioned I felt getting into TRNSMT was a little disorganised but the staff were helpful in directing us. On the accessible viewing platform the staff were extremely helpful in getting us a place to sit, going to collect food for us and just in general checking we were okay.

Whilst on  With this being an outdoor event I felt safe visiting with Covid-19 still around. I didn't notice any COVID precautions around the festival though, I didn't personally go to any of the food trucks but from a distance walking past I didn't see any hand sanitiser. I also didn't see any beside the the  TRNSMT Festival The staff were really helpful!. We were apprehensive before our visit to the first festival/gig since the pandemic started. If I am honest, that feeling didn’t go away especially as the crowd grew. The music offered a welcome distraction. There was a mobiloo and various toilets to suit different nee      TRNSMT Festival My Experience. At the start the staff didn't allow me to get on to the viewing platform because I didn't have a certain badge. I thought this was really poor      TRNSMT Festival Well positioned viewing platform and changing places toilet. The viewing platform is well positioned, using the paths in the park so that you do not need to drive on the grass. The changing places toilet and wheelchair accessible toilets are fenced off so only available to those who have applied to       TRNSMT Festival Wheelchair friendly, fantastic atmosphere, great music. I was hesitant to go to a music festival in my power chair however the organisers have arranged everything so that wheelchair users can simply enjoy the day. There is a platform looking right onto the main stage, with helpful and friendly staff There is a street closed off for blue badge parking. All you need to do is show your blue badge and show your ticket. The festival is held within Glasgow Green which is all on one level, with a viewing platform looking straight onto the main stage, and a concrete path which leads straight to the viewing area. There are disabled toilets throughout the festival, including a large number within the enclosed viewing platform area. The toilets are well stocked with toilet roll which is topped up throughout the day, there is water for washing your hands and there is alcohol and sanitiser. Staff helpful and friendly, the staff within the viewing platform know their stuff and are more than willing to help. I really didn't think a music festival would be as comfortable as it was, if you get there early and are at the front of the viewing platform, this is your space for the rest of the day whether you move or not. The staff were understanding, friendly and more than willing to help with anything that n"
Cineworld,"Cineworld The Spy Who Dumped me. The disabled seating area was to close to the front of the screen. The screen was chilly . 
The lift accessing the cinema was ok and quite spacious. The staff seemed to be helpful. 
The Starbucks next to the cinema is quite spacious with furniture you can move. 
We asked if It had space for taxi drivers to drop us off. There was a spacious lift. We were in screen 13 and it did not have an access box therefore the accessible seating was at the front, meaning that we were sitting too close to the screen. There is not a lot of space for a transfer from wheelchair onto the toilet. The general space to have your career in was not good. It was clean and smelt ok. Staff were very helpful and accommodating.  
Rehman Ali took time to show us the access boxes and was very polite. I would not have any concerns approaching them in the future. I would visit this cinema again, however, there are improvements that are needed such as access to toilets, temperature in screens and informing people of the disabled seating areas/ access boxes. Cineworld Cinema access. I ent last year to look at the access for my wheelchair at the cinema in Silverburn. The floor manager took my husband and I into 6 of the cinemas to show us the seating provided for disabled customers and their caters. He also said that if I wanted to sit in a regular seat they would Buses are frequent and go into Glasgow and surrounding areas. Parking for disabled is abundant in the multistory car park and outside Access is via lifts there are 2 that take you to the cinema foyer. Disabled toilets in the cinema and outside in the shopping mall all disabled toilets are of a good size  and clean Staff very helpful. I thought it was above and beyond taking us behind the scenes to show us the seating. I was very impressed took the stress out of not knowing. That’s why I love euans guide so much Cineworld Great big cinema with private booths. First time visiting this cinema, although we have wanted to try it for a while. It's a great big cinema within Silverburn shopping centre, so it's in a great location for shops and restaurants as well as access to changing places toilet. Large carpark as part of the Silverburn shopping centre so there are lots of disabled bays. There is a lift up to the cinema and once you exit the lift there is a large foyer area. The floor is black gloss with specks of sparkle, which is lovely and reminds me of space.  

There was a lowered section at the counter to buy tickets and food. 

We were in screen 9 which had wheelchair spa There was an accessible toilet outside the screen which I found to be very small. There was not enough space at the side of the toilet for side transfers and not enough space for turning my wheelchair. I believe there is another accessible toilet in the foyer, but I didn't see inside that one. If yo They seemed friendly and helpful. I will definitely visit this cinema again and hopefully try the private booth the next time. Cineworld Shocking if you don't have good eyesight. visited with my partner ....we are both registered blind  with differing levels of remaining vision, she is a wheelchair user. I have to completely disagree with the initial review 
the seating is pot luck depending on the  screen number itself, example we s  There is a single width lift ....no use for large motorised chairs or scooters  Staff are great on the few occasions we have been there and actually managed to see a movie Disabled access at this cinema is a lottery ....in that you can show up and not be guaranteed a seat or being able to actually see it from the god awful seating positions that are not available to see where you'll be sitting until your in the cinema ....(no online previewing of seat positions) Cineworld Best seats in the house!. The larger screens have a private viewing box at the back of the theatre, which is accessed by a lift. Come out the lift and there are doors off the corridor to each of the larger screens, and there is access to a disabled toilet. We were in screen 1, which has 2 seats and  Plenty of parking in silverburn shopping centre car park, you do have to walk right through the centre. Hubby is in a wheelchair and finds it claustrophobic when the centre is busy to get through the crowds. OK when quieter though. 
We drove, not sure about public transport. A lift to get to the cinema, easy access with wheelchair. Loos in foyer and also outside screens Very nice, helpful showing to to access screens for the first time Accepted cinema card no problem"
Cineworld,"Cineworld Disabled access is a lottery. Despite other glowing reviews i feel a few points have been over looked regarding actuall acess to screens this being ..the wheelchair spaces per screen ... given the number of screens i have only found 3 that have you in a central location (4rth or 5th row) ... others  Parking is hit and miss but if your lucky you can temporarily park at the front ...ideal for offloading the wheelchair Access inside cinema is good (when the lifts work) ...actuall screens is a different story see main review Toilets are usually clean unless your unlucky enough to be in one directly after someone with poor hygiene... happened to us a few times Staff generally great ... but some clueless ones amongst them Book well in advance to get the actuall screen and seat you want if you leave it to late you may be out of luck Cineworld A fun day out with the family. A large cinema in the heart of the city centre with good wheelchair access. We enjoyed our day at the cinema before heading for some dinner in the city centre too. It's surrounded by lots of shops, cafes, restaurants etc so the location is pretty ideal. We parked in the nearby multistorey carpark which was only a few minutes walk away. As the cinema is located in the busy city centre, it may be difficult to find a parking space on the street nearby, but you may be lucky and find one. There is also Buchanan Bus Station across from the cinema and the There is a wheelchair accessible door at the main entrance (it's just to the right of the revolving door). There are lifts which will take you to whichever level your movie is screening. I believe there are 6 levels in this cinema. Our movie was on level 3. The food and drink counters aren't very wh I believe there are accessible toilets on each level. The accessible toilet on our level was quite small. Once inside the loo and the door was closed, it was a struggle for my companion to lift me safely due to the lack of space between my wheelchair and the toilet. There wasn't any space for turnin The staff we encountered were all helpful and friendly.  Cineworld Very accesible. The side door isn't wheelchair friendly as it has several sets of stairs.However the main entrance has no steps and a larger door so people in wheelchairs can get through. There are 3 lifts inside the building for easy access to each level. Overall very good experience as staff are v Cineworld doesn't have a private car park however there are public car parks nearby.     Cineworld Entertainment for all. Upon entry, there is a automatic door to enter the premises.  Once in the building, to your left, there is a choice of 3 lifts to all floors (wheelchair friendly/spacious). There are multiple members of staff which are friendly and are happy to help on each floor. Within the c Cineworld has no official parking, however this venue is situated in the middle of town. It is right opposite the bus station and surrounding shopping centres have disabled parking available which are not far from entrance. Lifts are available to all floors. Induction loops are also available. Easy access to spacious seats. Some of the cinema seats are on level ground so stairs will not be an issue. Easy to find, and very clean. Toilets are on every floor and are checked regularly. Disabled toilets are available. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend a trip to this cinema. I had a great time. Cineworld Cineworld Glasgow. Cineworld Glasgow is not great for those with autism anymore. when you go in the ground floor has bright lights and very loud music. they have taken away most of the counters and have to wait in line longer. they have a massive screen which is always on and have bright lights behi No disabled parking near by They have 1 door for wheelchairs but does not open easily and have 2 revolving doors that go to fast Don't have large changing facilities Staff friendly Need to be more autism friendly"
King's Theatre,"King's Theatre I love to  go to see  musicals. I have been in the  kings few times and even although it is  a old building it is very accessibility we didn't take the car so we got the bus to near by then walk it, it isn't that  a far a walk there is a side door which it is just for wheelchairs.  this is quite good because you don't need to wait in a long line.  once you get in the theatre it is all   flat and the wheelchair  bit is at the back at theatre where you get a good view the disabled toilet is very small with folding door.I don't think there is any space for a changing places the staff was nice and helpful  King's Theatre John Grant. John Grant gig as part of Celtic Connections it was cold. No parking unless pay for.in nearest NCP It's a side door, you ting a bell and someone comes a d gets you. You sit right at back next to sound box. No.othwr choice of space or seats back or nothing..Exit door to outside was near us, so quite cold with draft.. N/A Friendly and quick.to get us in The booking is never simple. Have to trawl through Kings Theatre website to get number then only at limited times. Could only get tickets and disabled discount if I went into Theatre in city with CEA card.. King's Theatre Not pleasant if you need the loo. The accessible door is at the side of the building via a fire exit. There is an intercom to contact staff if the doors aren't open. 
The ""accessible"" toilet- (a very loose description) is not big enough for a wheelchair user with assistance, it has a bifold door, i Getting the train is so easy, 2 minute walk from charing x station. Best to book ahead for platform assistance with ramps. Unfortunately the accessible loo is not suited to a wheelchair user requiring personal assistance. 

Parking is close by, if you are lucky enough to get a space. 

There is     It is not the best experience as a wheelchair user.  There is no access to the bar, although probably just as well because you will likely need to keep your legs crossed!

Being right at the back, there are lots of distractions when people get up for the loo, which has the whole row needing to sta King's Theatre Tired venue that does its best. The theatre is old and characterful but disabled facilities leave much to be desired.  Staff are excellent in helping and trying to overcome deficiencies.  Wheelchair space is at rear of stalls, so fine if all action is on stage floor.  Hope there are no balcony 
sce On street parking all around theatre Level but have to call staff to open door Smallish and not best location.  Folding doors are a bit off-putting Friendly and very helpful  King's Theatre Not accessible. Rating is for staff only who were extremely helpful.  We were 
Shown to seats which are at the very back of the stalls.  
If anyone on stage is on a balcony cannot see them as balcony comes down so far.  Pictures were dropped down during singing but could only see bottom of these.  Have to go to front door and ask for side door to be opened. Did not use these Staff were really helpful We were 2 wheelchair users and 1 ambulant disabled."
Barrowland Ballroom,"Barrowland Ballroom Much improved wheelchair access. At last I'm able to attend gigs at this iconic venue There is plenty of on street parking in the vicinity, free with a blue badge, but no dedicated car park. As a manual wheelchair user, I was able to use the stair climber that is now in use here. A first time experience for me, but it was fine. The staff were exceptionally helpful and reassuring. It got me into the gig, and back to a venue I hadn't been able to access for many years, so I'm not complain There is an accessible loo, a larger cubicle in the ladies'. Assuming there's on in the gents' too?! It is functional but basic. The main downside is that it's on a different floor to the main concert area, so the stair climber needs to be used. Again, the staff could not have been more helpful. I've said it already. Brilliant. A lift would be the obvious improvement but they're not going to do it as far as I can see. The stair climber is a means to an end and it worked for me.  I'll be back! Barrowland Ballroom Recent post about wheelchair accessability is greatly exagerated. Despite a recent review here advising us that this venue is wheelchair friendly, it is not. I phoned the venue concerning an upcoming show today, to be told that the have a stairclimber which negates the old habit of being carried up       Barrowland Ballroom Improved wheelchair access. This is now a wheelchair accessible venue with very friendly and helpful staff.      Barrowland Ballroom Absolutely NO WHEELCHAIR ACCESS to world famous venue. If you've ever dreamed of seeing your favourite band play on stage at the famous Barrowlands Ballroom in Glasgow, but you also happen to use a wheelchair, then no luck pal, you're not getting in :(
I'm giving this half a star for the sheer effo  Staff have had absolutely no disability awareness training whatsoever which becomes apparent as soon as conversation begins. 
There is no lift. Not even for musical equipment. ""There's a hoist for gear, but it'll no do the likes of that"" said a member of staff to my friend whilst nodding in my dire  *some* staff were nice enough if a little misguided. The owner did not seem to care. He simply stated, ""no we have no access or anything like that"" then asked me if I was the one ""making all the fuss"" :(  Barrowland Ballroom A relic best left in the past.No wheelchair access. 

One of my favourite artists played so I took them up on their offer of carrying me up flights of stairs. This was to an area at the rear that they used for spotlights decades ago. There wasn't even room to straighten my chair toward the stage.

The theatre can remove certain seats in the stalls for wheel Plenty of on street parking     Theatre Royal excellent disabled access and facilities. Easy access to venue. Good range of disabled toilets. Choice of seats.  Extremely helpful staff.      Theatre Royal Friendly staff at lovely new theatre. Visited Theatre Royal on Disabled Access Day. Staff were lovely and happy to show us around and tell us about their accessible performances. I'm not sure about the nearest bus stop, but there is parking nearby. We walked from Queen Street Station which is about 10 minutes away. Staff are happy to book taxis and assist people into taxis where necessary. There is wheelchair access from all entrances and lift access to each floor. The theatre has many wheelchair spaces available and seats can be taken out to create more wheelchair spaces. We saw that there were accessible toilets on each floor. The one that we saw was fairly small. Staff were great, very friendly and helpful and clued up about their venue's accessibility. They were very enthusiastic about making their venue accessible and excited to be involved in Disabled Access Day for the first time. Theatre Royal has a great range of access performances including audio described, captioned, signed and relaxed performances. Theatre Royal Theatre Royal, Glasgow. I had occasion to attend the new Theatre Royal, Glasgow and was deeply impressed at the attention given to accessible services. The accessible seating was roomy, comfortable and had a clear view of the stage. I had room for my carer and a friend, all of us sitting together to Although a public car park nearby, lets me be dropped off and the car then parked in car park. The facilities in the theatre make it pleasant to wait for carers returning. The toilet facilities were roomy, having room to turn my chair with ease and comfort. A gold star to all concerned. "
Glasgow Film Theatre GFT,"Glasgow Film Theatre GFT Access Film Club. I am a regular for this tuesday thing is its the 2nd tuesday of the month and I support it due to the city centre this is hard for parking unless its after 6pm and you can park in the side streets for free this venue has got access for people with a disability, I am not sure on this but I am guessing they would have disabled toilets Jodie the co-ordinator for the Access Film Club is very nice and she loves to speak to people and she makes the movies really good Please come along and support this great chance to watch the movies with others with a disability Glasgow Film Theatre GFT Thumbs up for the GFT. I was amazed at how they've managed to make such an old building so accessible. Very pleasantly surprised! There is on street parking on Sauchiehall Street, but it can get busy. Plenty of public transport links available, given the city centre location. They have worked incredibly hard to make the building as accessible as possible. There is level access from the street, although the hill getting to the main door is pretty steep!  It does at times feel a little disjointed internally, as you have to pop on and off a couple of lifts while in there if The loos were easy enough to find, good signage and spacious enough for me. As you would expect, the staff were extremely helpful on the day! Very pleasant, welcoming and willing to help. We were there for a visit during Disabled access day, but I'm hoping that level of service is the norm! It's a great cinema experience. Give a little extra time to get around on the way to the screen as the accessible entrances to certain screens can involve a detour. Glasgow Film Theatre GFT Beautiful Art Deco Cinema. The building is fairly tight in places but we were very impressed with what they've done to make it accessible. Not sure about parking. We wheeled up from Buchanan St.  Is close to Buchanan St bus station, Queen st railway station. There is also lots of parking at Buchanan Galleries shopping centre which isn't too far away. There are automated doors to get in and a lowered counter at the ticket desk. The access to the 3 screens varies. There is a lift to Cinema 1 and its got 4 wheelchair spaces at the front.  Cinema 2 has 2 wheelchair spaces at the back, as does Cinema 3.  You are advise to phone to book the wheelchair There are accessible loos. Staff were great.  While you cant get to the bar upstairs as a wheelchair user, they will bring drinks down to you at the seating area beside the 'hatch in the wall' which sells snacks.  Glasgow Film Theatre GFT A hidden gem!. Access to the Glasgow film theatre went beyond my expectation. It was great to discover that all three screens were wheelchair accessible; and easily so. Excited to see the range of performances such as captioned, BSL and relaxed. Some on street parking. Buses travel close by and would be easily used. Getting into the building from street level as a wheelchair user was easy via the level access automated doors. The booking office had to drop counter and an induction loop; as well as payment card machines that were at a reasonable height and easy to use.Signage points you the right direction and t The accessible toilet I visited near to screens two and three was large spacious well-equipped and spotlessly clean. It had a little more space than you often find. It's approached via a short corridor off of which you perform a 90° turn. The staff I met and spoke to were very knowledgeable, helpful and enthusiastic. Sometimes when out and about you find places to go way beyond your expectation. This was one of those places and I hope to be able to visit again and enjoy some of the screenings that take place. I found the two smaller screens to be quite appealing as you don't have the large crowds, it feels a lit"
The Dockyard Social,"The Dockyard Social Accessible venue but noisy. It's a converted warehouse with concrete floor. The main entrance is stepped so use the Exit to enter as it's on the level.

There is an accessible toilet but I had to wait as staff were using it. The door is hard to pull closed and could do with a bar or swing close hing  Accessible as a minimum but not great. 
Toilet could be better.
Space between tables an issue.
Pre booking of wheelchair accessible seating would be good. Staff were using.
Smelt of urine and did not smell clean. Was hard to get in and hard to close the door.
Needs a pull bar on door with spring hinge on door. The door swings away from you so is hard to reach in a chair. Didn't find the table staff friendly. They wanted to move me off one of the only wheelchair accessible tables.
The table they asked me to move to, I could not get there in a wheelchair as the other benches were too close. I could not fit.  The Dockyard Social Best street food in Glasgow. Went for dinner with my PA Beca. This place is easy access, spacious, disability aware and just the best food! Reasonably priced delicious and freshly made food.

Glasgow Central Railway Station,"At Glasgow Central station, staff are always helpful and provide assistance when   required.I tend to travel a lot from this station long distance to England. Busy railway station with easy access to most major cities in the country.k If i were to try navigate this independently I wouldn’t be able to do it. This could be because I haven’t had the mobility training to teach me my way around. Luckily if i did need to go here on my own i could use assistance. I came to Scotland through central station and honestly I got one of the best ‘first impressions’ I have had as I noticed from that day that the people in glasgow are so friendly The station can be very confusing when you can't hear what the person on the speakers is trying to say I haven't been in Glasgow Central since the Lock Downs.However, I always it very disorientating as there is such a wide space with no tactile help. I think there ought to be paths created by tactile tiles, such as there is in the airport for Rome.  I was guiding a blind student, from the university and the station staff offered support at the barriers ensuring that the student was able to board the train safely. Good. Lighting is good and mobility help is available.  Glasgow Central Railway Station a great station. I am  in central station every week but not to travel.  I use the station for changing places toilet hoist because it is a great toilet the bus which I get in to town stops outside central station and I think most of buses stops outside it too. the station is all flat. most of entrances has ramps or lifts there is a great changing places which it is always nice and   clean.  to get in to the changing places you press the call button and somebody usually comes quite  quick but sometimes I  can be waiting quite while to   get in to the changing places all staff are nice  Glasgow Central Railway Station Brilliant Service. Been a great experience at Glasgow Central Station, the network rail staff are brilliant, never had any major issues with them Great transport from this railway station Venue is easy to navigate and is very accessible their is lifts from the high level to the low level their is 2 accessible toilets one of them is a changing places toilet The staff have been brilliant at Glasgow Central Station, from the mobility team to the Gate Line team at Glasgow Central Station  Glasgow Central Railway Station Central station. Train station located in the city centre of Glasgow. Many different train routes that take you all around Glasgow and surrounding areas. Frequent cross country trains also. There is no parking at the station, unless you don't mind parking your car on the streets next to it. There is a bus stop directly infront of the stations main entrance. There is also a taxi rank outside main entrance, where you can either get dropped off or if you need a taxi, there is always taxis Big main entrance. No stairs to get into station and no lift is needed to enter station either. There is a side entrance that has quite a few stairs but they aren't steep and there is railings on both sides, all the way up and down. 

There are seats in the centre of the station and there is also, Disabled toilets are easily accessible, key required. There are other toilets but you have to walk down stairs to get to them Staff are always helpful if you need it. Many staff all over the station and in the ticket offices.  Glasgow Central Railway Station A Railway Hub. Arriving at the station it was a bit daunting by its size and loads of platforms. Soon got the hang of it  as the signage was good. A great transport hub with loads of trains going to all parts and several long distance ones. Buses stopped outside the door and there was a taxi rank. Greeting around the station was easy for us as two powerchair users once we worked out the signage. It's fairly level once you are inside but there's a small incline to go up to get into the main station concourse. Some of the platforms are on a lower level but the lifts are clearly marked. There is an accessible loo but it was tucked away in a corner by the main entrance. It might not be too easy to find for some folk. It is a good size and easy to get in. Staff were very helpful and friendly. "
Browns,"Browns Good venue. Easy access entrance 
Easy access for food and drink.  Good venue for dinner and drinks.
On the level access. Loads of parking has been removed around George sq so it needs luck to find any space. Or get a taxi. Easy access at front door. Level access inside.
Good space between tables. Average typical accessible toilet. Small, could not turn but did the job. Multiple handrails.
Staff were helpful with the door for me. Very friendly and helpful  Browns Good access, central location. The floor level access led to a bar area, then to the dining space. The tables and chairs are packed in but there is just enough room for a wheelchair to carefully manoeuvre. Across the square from Queens Street Train Station with plenty of on street parking. Level access and just enough room to manoeuvre around. Spacious and clean   Browns Delicious Afternoon Tea in George Square. Great location in the heart of Glasgow’s George Square for drinks after work or for me afternoon tea. Plenty of on street parking available and free for blue badge holders. However, none available when I visited so I parked in Buchanan Galleries which is a 5 minute walk away. 

With it being right in the city centre lots of public transport available. Queens Street railway station is across the ot Not great signage to know where place is. You have to look at more the signage on windows but if sun is shining directly on windows may be harder to see. Door entrance is not automatic and may be too heavy for someone with difficult mobility to open however, I always have someone with me. 

Very s Cannot comment as I did not use the disabled toilet, although I could see it from where I was sitting and there was a clear pathway to it. Staff could not have been nicer. Checked with us on dietary requirements and were very accommodating when my friend said she was a vegetarian. 

The girl that served us was very welcoming and took time to speak to us which showed great customer service. Did not catch her name however, visited Frid Great afternoon tea for an affordable price, would definitely recommend visiting and will be going back again sometime when in Glasgow. Browns Drinks right on the square. The location is ideal, very spacious inside and great service! On street parking around George square which is directly opposite the venue. All on street parking is free with the blue badge. Walking distance from Queen Street station too which is handy. Level access from the street but there is no automatic door but the swing door isn't too heavy. The signage for all bars in that area is pretty poor so you need to look at the signs on the window. The accessible loo is opened with a radar key. If you don't have your own you can request one from behind the bar. The loo itself is pretty small (see pic) so some larger wheelchair users or people with visual impairmets may struggle to get around. The staff were very helpful and gave a warm welcome on arrival. Would definitely recommend this venue for food and drinks when visiting glasgow. Close to the shopping venues, tourist attractions and transport routes."
SWG3 Studio Warehouse,"SWG3 Studio Warehouse SWG3 (Galvanisers): An accessible review. Good venue with a great platform for wheelchair users but no parking. Friendly staff, I'll be back soon. Unfortunately the venue has extremely limited parking. Around 12. Although these spaces are likely to be taken up unless you go to your gig super early. I parked around a 5/10 min walk from the venue.

The location is awkward so can't see this changing any time soon. Once I got to the front door of the venue, staff took us through a separate door to the hall through the bar which looked very accessible. Once inside the Hall, there was ramped access to the viewing platform at the back. The 2 ramps lead you to a fairly high platform which gives a fantastic view of Accessible and easy to find. Definitely enough room for an electric wheelchair as well as a carer. Clean and tidy. Not sure if there were grab rails. Very helpful stuff. Lead us directly to the accessible ramp for the viewing platform.  As soon as we arrived they asked who we there to see with no waiting about. At the end of the gig they helped us through the busy crowd to the exit. Don't forget the sound! Music sounded great although mics were a bit too loud which lead to some distortion here and there. Similar to other smaller venues with a good view. 

Enjoyable experience overall and I'll be back very soon. SWG3 Studio Warehouse 'Dear Europe' (National Theatre Scotland event).I attended the 'Dear Europe' event organised by the National Theatre of Scotland on the day that we were supposed to Brexit.  It was a mix of celebration and sadness of cultures and identities and views about the possible future for all of us and what  It could be difficult to get here by train or subway depending upon your disability as stations are about 10-14 minutes walk away.  I came by car and was directed into a locked car-park manned by security adjacent to the venue.  There was plenty of space and staff were very helpful, holding gates et As already mentioned the ground is a bit bumpy and uneven, however, access inside the venue itself was very good with lots of space to move around.  I was assigned an assistant to take me to my seat which they had reserved for me and which was with everyone else at long benches and chairs.  I felt t Sorry, I was unable to check out the toilets as I had to leave sharpish and I meant to return the next day to take a photo but I couldn't make it.

They made the whole experience even better. I loved the conversion and the atmosphere in this fantastic venue; it had an underground air of excitement about it and this definitely enhanced all the performances.

Princes Square Shopping Centre,"Princes Square Shopping Centre Princes Square. Prince’s Square

•	Ramp at main entrance and automatic doors so access into the building is good 
•	Corridor leading into the building is very spacious which helps with the accessibility
•	The lifts inside the main part of the square are quite narrow and cramped which might not suit  Many parking facilities located in Glasgow city centre which is a walk away from Princes Square. 
2 train stations close by. (Glasgow Queen street, Glasgow Central Station)
A bus station also close by. (Buchanan Bus station) There are many lifts located inside Princes Square. 
Slopes for wheelchair access.
Automatic doors. There was toilets on most floors right next to lift access. Didn't particularly interact with staff but all seemed friendly and smiley.  Princes Square Shopping Centre Accessibility of  Princess Square to the Public. Princes Square is a place for customers to relax, enjoy and socialize with friends such as shopping and a variety of restaurants. There is no disabled parking outside the princes square shopping center in which the customers would have a long distance to walk up to Buchanan galleries car park or st Enoch. The main entrances to Princes Square through the three level  access points are accessible in which there are escalators, lifts and flat surfaces. However due to my past experiences of being in princes square the lifts and escalators have been out of order at several points during the day. For examp The main disabled toilets are on the ground floor so if the lifts and escalators were not accessible it would hinder the customer getting to the toilet. This is because they would have to take the stairs which would take longer and more energy consuming. The staff and security guards are helpful and efficient in terms of  walking round each level, checking customers are getting where they want to be within the shopping center.  Princes Square Shopping Centre Princes Square Shopping Centre. This shopping centre is located on Buchanan Street in the city centre, it has a range of shops, bars and restaurants.

Princes Square Shopping Centre So many lifts!. A well thought out Princes Mall earns a deserved five stars. Great experience, friendly staff, and well designed layout.  From arriving in the Centre the atmosphere and experience was a good one. The entrance we used had a slight incline up into the Centre but was easily managed by our powerchairs. Once inside the clear signage gave you a sense of what's where. On different levels there were several choices of lifts to With more than one accessible loo; the one we used was brilliantly signposted. Had a good wide door, plenty of space, grab rails and was spotlessly clean. Staff get full marks. On more than one occasion we were asked if we needed any assistance as we moved around the floors, shops and eateries. All done in a discrete and helpful manner. There are plenty of places to eat here and several shops. The only comment we'd make is the signage on the lift buttons in the two glass lifts is hard to read being bronze with engraved characters. That aside, the design, layout and experience was a great example of how things can be done to assist "

It was just big enough to get my chair in, though my chair is not the smallest. Good placement of handrails and clean. This might be because you will need a radar key to open it. I had my own.

Mitchell Library and Theatre,"Mitchell Library and Theatre A decent place to study, but not without access challenges. The Mitchell Library is a lovely building and a great place to study, but due to the old style of the upper floors, the access is not optimal. There are three disabled spaces to the left of the entrance on Granville Street. The markings are very worn out, so you can barely read the markings, but despite this, I've never had an issue getting a space. Parking is free for blue badge holders. There is level access into the building, with automatic doors at the entrance. There is elevator access to all floors. 

The ground floor is more modern, and access is generally very good. Upper floors are difficult to navigate in a manual chair due to the thick carpet and narrow, heavy wooden doo There are two accessible toilets on the ground floor, and possibly one on the first floor, but I've never been to it, so can't comment. 

One of the toilets on the ground floor, located nearest the main doors, is decent. The door isn't too heavy, and there's enough space, though it isn't very spac Friendly and helpful staff. When I had my hair tied back and my hearing aids were visible, the staff at the cafe showed me the price of what I was paying for, which was appreciated - usually, I have to ask people to write it down if I want to know the price of something, even if my hearing aids are   Mitchell Library and Theatre A great place to study!. Really beautiful building on the outside and on the inside. Plenty of spacious areas to relax, read and perhaps even do a spot of studying. Level access throughout the entire building, and two medium sized lifts giving you access to all floors. Disabled friendly toilets dott I drove to the venue and used the on-street parking which is situated on the left hand side and round the back of the building. Level access throughout the building, with lifts to all floors. Friendly staff on hand to assist wherever needed and disabled friendly toilets are available. Disabled access into the building is situated around the back - with automatic doors. More than one disabled toilet, which is always a welcome sign. Not the most spacious in the world, but enough to get by and there are grab rails present. The toilet I chose to use wasn't the cleanest at the time, but I'm sure that was just a one-off. Super friendly and engaging staff members, all too happy to help! The Mitchell Library is a great venue to check out if you want to take some time out and do a spot of reading or studying. There is also a Genealogy Suite in the building where you can examine archives and trace back your heritage.

There are only disabled toilets on the ground floor. Staff were very helpful with any questions i had.  Mitchell Library and Theatre Agile working at Mitchell library. Although the whole building is wheelchair accessible with great lift access etc. some areas are tricky to manoeuvre independently due to heavy wooden double doors. The bottom floor (new extension) however is fantastic in terms of access. 3 on street disabled bays directly in front of the level access entry point to the library (Granville street). Disabled access to he building is ideal with 3 automatic double doors taking you into the ground floor with a cafe, computer suite, visual impairment unit and 2 lifts to all floors. There were 2 disabled toilets on the ground floor that i used. Both were perfect for me and very spacious, but 1 of the toilets had 2 single doors to go through that were close together which could prove an issue for anyone in an electric wheelchair. Staff were extremely helpful and took time to walk me through the free wifi connection process (a little time consuming first time around). They could not do enough for me throughout my visit. There is free wifi connectivity on the ground floor which made this a perfect venue for my agile office. The downstairs cafe has little work stations that allow you to set up your own laptop etc and work while enjoying a tea, coffee (and in my case a large slice of carrot cake)"
Loks Bar & Kitchen,"Loks Bar & Kitchen Dinner with friends. Dinner with friends. A nice restaurant with easy access Can park at back, but we did not see that. Parking  on street but no dropped kerb. Entrance is at the side znd then you go through a curtain. Ramp to door. It did seem a bit if a squeeze for the waitress to get by my chair to the table behind me, but this is where they seated us (I had to them.that I was in a powerchair)  Overall they were very good, though we did have to ask twice for a couple of things. Point Star Martini was not that great. Loks Bar & Kitchen Nice place - all right grub. It is situated beside the Newlands Morrison's. So there is plenty of parking and good transport links. There are a different transport links couple of hundred yards from the door. One of these is Pollockshaws East railway station but it is inaccessible for wheelchair users. There is a good or service. There is a ramp to the side entrance. You have to make yourself visible to the staff in-doors, this was easy enough. Although I've not shown a great picture the toilet was very good. It has a bi-folding door which are great space savers. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. It has a great function space for parties. Loks Bar & Kitchen good food, nice staff, comfortable venue. if you can manage a couple of steps in the front door, from thereon in its all on the level a with wide spaces between tables and good toilet facilities. Even better, the food is good and the staff are helpful. on Street parking but very busy once you climb the couple of steps at the front door everything afterwards is very accessible. clean, freshly painted, large, uncluttered and easily accessible. very pleasant and helpful food good and obviously busy as a consequence Loks Bar & Kitchen Nice busy pub/restaurant for everyone. Ramped entry to the side door (not automatic) a few tight spaces inside but enough room to accommodate passage for a large wheelchair. Good height tables, nice food. There is a carpark for the football club next door which offers a level pathway to the ramped side door but spaces are minimal and on street parking is always jam packed. There is a good low gradient ramp into the side door. The door is not automatic so you need staff to catch your eye, however each time I've visited it's been really busy and I've been welcomed inside rather quickly. There's a wee bit of a bump over the threshold but once inside you have clear access Didn't visit the toilet. Staff were helpful but absolutely run off their feet. I could have done with a bit more service at the table as going to the bar was difficult and I  had to keep asking friends to go for me as we waited ages for anyone to come take a drinks order. But once the food and drinks arrived it made for a f Nice well presented food, good drinks in an accessible place to meet up. Good big venue."
Armadillo,"Armadillo Good venue, parking facilities not great.Overall the venue was good. Nice and bright, which helps me as I'm visually impaired, and the staff were very supportive when it came to giving me assistance. I couldn't see any blue badge parking nearby though, although there was a drop-off right outside, an Public transport links are good - the train station has lift access and the bridge is step free. There is a drop off point right outside. The parking arrangements really let it down, there is blue badge parking in the multi-story carpark nearby, but it's 500m away. The area is open plan, step free, and easy to navigate. Signage is clear. The only thing that is difficult to navigate, as a VI person, is the slight incline up to the main auditorium. This is more of a surprise than a difficulty and once you know it's there it's easy to navigate. I was sat in the 2 I can't personally comment on the accessible toilets as I didn't use them. Staff were helpful throughout. A bit disappointed that they don't offer companion tickets in the main seating area. As a blind person, I don't want to take up the wheelchair accessible seating but if I want a companion ticket - as is standard at most other Glasgow venues - then I'm not able to get one. Armadillo disabled parking. If you have walking difficulties and are driving yourself, then parking in the multi storey car park is no good as it's a fair walk from there to the Armadillo. It would be most helpful if the area of ground opposite the Armadillo, which annoyingly lies empty, could be used for dis Multi storey car park     Armadillo A good view.I've heard disabled friends say they don't like the access areas are at the sides of the auditorium. I like it.  Just anything but the back- don't put me to the back.  I promise to be good! 
I've always had a good view here and am pleased when I see artists I like are playing it.      Armadillo Access Review. Very easy access  inside  of the building with ramped access to the disabled viewing area  on either side of the stage on the lower level with a good view. The Auditorium hasn't got a car park, the multi storey at The Hydro is used.  That has a reasonable amount of disabled spaces.  Easy access  if you are dropped off point at the door. Disabled access is reasonable and accessible. Haven't used them but am sure they are adequate Staff are helpful and friendly. "
DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central,"DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central Hosting a Euan's Guide stall. Running a Euan's Guide stall at a Head Injuries Information Day. Only used exhibition space down stairs not bedrooms. Fine to get train to Glasgow and walk about 15 minutes. Not sure of parking options other than at Buchanan Galleries. Automatic doors, step free, smooth carpets. Some heavy doors but staff ready to help. One was far too long and thin so very hard to lock door and then unlock to get out. No possibility of transferring. The other one was better but both needed red cord cards after untangled the cord. Hepful  DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central Allocation of accessible room is seriously problematic. This might be a beautiful hotel, all accessible, friendly, clean, comfortable. But there is a serious problem for anyone who wishes to have an accesible room. You can book it anyway you like, including in person and then confirming by phone but We had specialised transport but there is no drop-off or pick-up parking outside Once you are in the hotel, everything is accessible. But you'll have had to surmount the booking and drop-off problems before you can get in and get a room.  A bit of staff training about how it might feel to be dealt with on the basis of 'do you really need the accessible room?' would be useful but it is the management decision about room allocation which is the major disaster here and, I think, in all Hilton hotels.  DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central Glasgow hotel. The Doubletree by Hilton is the old hospitality Inn on Cambridge Street in Glasgow City center. I have been here many times for conferences etc. This time I was dropped off by taxi at the front door.

It has automatic doors. There is lift access to the different floors. They have three accessible toilets. Two on the ground floor and one on the eighth. Because I was here with the Glasgow disability alliance there was plenty of assistance at hand. The only staff in the hotel I had dealings with were at reception and they seemed pleasant enough. It would be a good hotel for visits to Glasgow with its proximity to the city center. DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central Hotel in Central Glasgow. Myself and my friend stayed in an accessible suite at the Thistle hotel for one night. The room had two double beds and an accessible bathroom. Their was plenty of room to move a wheelchair around in. There is an underground carpark if you go round the back of the hotel that has disabled parking in it. It costs £6 per night and there are lifts that take you straight into the hotel. Level access on all floors and the doors where more than wide enough to accomodate a wheelchair. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because in the bar area the only place that was suitable to sit was up 2 small steps (Luckily my friend could manage these). The Bathroom in the room suited our needs really well There were 2 shower heads - a fixed one for those that can stand under it and a handheld one (which lacked a bit of pressure) for those using the shower chair.

Overall access is fine apart of a long distance from the car park (Albion) and quite bumpy uneven pavement to the stadium gates. As mentioned above unfortunately the disabled parking is quite a fair bit from the stadium. Generally quite an easy and straight forward access - no hassle - for home AND away fans! Quite dated and definitely lacking space.. Staff were excellent and made our trip!
One on one help with clear professional and very friendly attitude. Easier to get around then you would think! Ibrox Stadium Great venue. Dedicated disabled parking, easy access and helpful staff. Disabled parking was available directly across the road from the stadium and there looked as though there were also a couple of disabled parking bays actually within the complex.

Reception is also the bar and if you go past this there is the restaurant/breakfast area. I did not eat in the hotel so can’t comment on access there.  There are two slim lifts to all floors which fit a powerchair but not much else. The corridor I only used the room toilet so cannot comment on any reception/ restaurant ones.

As I normally prefer standard rooms I have only used the wheelchair accessible room once.  I found this difficult to navigate and walked into furniture and fittings several times due to the confined space and low heights above the floor.      Hotel Ibis Glasgow City Centre Accessible both physically and in attitude. This hotel is close to Charing Cross train station. While the pavements in the vicinity are poor, the hotel itself is very accessible. The staff are the main asset. They are so friendly and helpful that they will find anything you need. Everything was easy We arrived by train and that was close by but the pavements in the area are in poor condition and there was not always a dropped kerb. We didn't have a car so I can't comment on parking. Flat, wide front entrance, good lift access. Only problem is the pavements but that's not the hotel's fault! In the bedroom, the loo was fully accessible, with a non-slip floor, which is helpful. There is no toilet on the ground floor but there is one on the first floor (lift access) which is convenient. The staff were terrific. Nothing was too much trouble and they were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommendable"
Hutchesons Bar and Brasserie,"Hutchesons Bar and Brasserie Stylish and accessible!. The highlight of the visit was being able to access all the areas of the building I wanted to. From the ground floor bar area and adjoining room through to the dining experience upstairs. All done with an eye for detail and a really funky lift to match! Transport by car to the venue was OK but it was a busy street and not the best for dropping off. That said, the approach along the pavement from the bus stops was fine. Several of my group walked across (two wheelchair users) from Queen Street station and it was surprisingly close and easy to get to A well deserved five stars! From being able to read an access statement in advance, through to level access to the building, a warm welcome, and an easy to move around environment it was really good. The dining area was easier to get to than I expected as a powerchair user and there was plenty of sp The accessible loo was large, very well appointed, and didn't feel like the usual accessible toilets you meet that seem like an afterthought. It was spotlessly clean and and large enough for me to turn my powerchair full circle; not always possible. Staff were fantastic. From the warm greeting at the door through to the attentive service it was faultless. Even down to showing me where the facilities were, holding doors and helping me embark from the fabulous glass lift. A great environment with a warm welcome. Would certainly put this on my personal list of places to revisit when I'm in Glasgow. Will also be telling my friends how good it was. Hutchesons Bar and Brasserie Funky Brasserie in heart of Glasgow. Loved this place - staff super - great effort been made to make it accessible - will definitely be returning! We got the train into Glasgow Queen Street and it is about 10 mins walk from there - very near to the Modern Art Gallery. There are some public car parks nearby that have blue badge spaces. There's two different entrances so make sure you enter via the step free one on Ingram Street. There is a very funky lift to take you to other floors. It's an old building with fabulous history that has been made accessible so expect a couple of quirky corners etc. dining room upstairs fantastic atm Good size - spotlessly clean and tidy - accessed via the lift. Just wonderful! Had obviously had some good staff training... An old fashioned and genuine Glasgow welcome! definitely will be recommending it to other people and will be visiting for more than coffee next time!! Hutchesons Bar and Brasserie Fine dining at Hutchesons. A wheelchair accessible restaurant and cafe with very attentive staff and a hot chocolate that's worth the journey alone. On street parking on the streets around the restaurant and a car park with a few minutes walk. There are some renovations on the outside at the moment,so scaffolding can make it difficult to notice the signage. There are 2 entrances but it is only the entrance on Ingram street that is wheelchair accessible. The side entrance has a few steps to negotiate once inside. The accessible loo is on the 1st floor and is accessed via a lift. It is quite tight inside but does have plenty of handrails. The staff were fantastic throughout the visit. They were very pleasant and were more than willing to make the visit as stress free as possible. The Hutchesons bar and brasserie is in the heart of Glasgow and  is within walking distance of George Square. It is perfect for a quick drink when visiting Glasgow or for a fine dinning meal with the family. Something for everyone!"
The Lighthouse,"The Lighthouse Accessible Mackintosh!. Was generally very impressed with the disabled access at The Lighthouse, although watch out for the lift at peak visitor times - it is very slow and busy as people attempt to access the viewing platform. We walked so I'm uncertain about public transport, although The Lighthouse is down a lane just off of the pedestrianised part of Buchanan Street which made it easy to reach. Generally really good! Revolving door to enter with alternative wheelchair accessible entrance directly beside it. Signage was helpful, space was light and bright. The lift to the viewing platform is good, although at peak visitor times it is very busy and slow moving. This is because there is no st Well signposted and reached via wide, spacious corridors. Very friendly and handed us a map/leaflet as we walked in.  The Lighthouse Not what I expected, great visit!. Visiting the Lighthouse for the first time I wasn't too sure what to expect. Getting in and getting around as a Powerchair user was easy and I'll certainly visit again. Parking and transport might be an issue for some people as the Ligthouse is set in a side street off Buchanan Street which in itself is pedestrianised. On arriving it was easy to get in via the large automated glass doors. The reception has a dropped area and the routes around the building well signposted. It was great to be able to explore the unexpected areas like the rooftop viewing point. A lift, escalator or stairs takes you to the different l The accessible toilets are clearly signposted and provide easy access. Full marks to the staff. On arriving the reception staff explained the layout and the best routes to take. This included pointing out the accessibility of the viewing area. In the exhibition areas I met other staff who were friendly and gave tips on what to see as we went around. The various exhibition and gallery areas were fascinating and we ran out of time looking around. There's also a cafe which is accessible and worth a visit. The Lighthouse Illuminating experience!!. I am having trouble describing this venue but a must visit if you're interested in architecture and design. It's a museum, gallery, library and information point to name but a few! Level access throughout and spacious. The one small drawback is a relatively small lift wher Being a city centre venue there is a good bus service nearby.
Train - Queen St station is approx 10 min away.
Car - unsure of any accessible parking close by.  I never used the accessible toilets so I am unable to review although going by everything else in this venue I would be surprised if they are not more than adequate. The staff I had dealings with were very friendly and extremely helpful. "
The Counting House,"The Counting House The Counting House. The building clearly states it’s name and where the disabled access is outside. The lift however, is operated manually meaning that a person is required to keep the button pressed until they reach the top. Bar is relatively high up but the Wetherspoons app makes it easy for anyon I got the train to Queen Street and walked down, 5 minutes maximum. Plenty of buses also pass the restaurant and parking is available at george square and surrounding areas.  Did not use the toilets but it was unclear as to where the disabled toilets are located, only signs for male and female which require you to go downstairs. Need to ask staff to find out. Staff were very friendly and happy to help you out.  The Counting House The Counting House. The Counting House is in a central location directly across from George Square. It has wide door access and a chair lift for wheelchair users for the few steps at the front door. There is also clear wheelchair access signage. The food is cheap and cheerful and the staff are alway There are bus stops all round George Square so public bus took me straight there. There was clear signage and a small lift for wheelchair users. Did not use the toilets. Friendly and efficient. Would visit again. The Counting House Welcoming pub /restaurant. Looking for a pub to have lunch was made easy by the nice clear sign outside the building with a wheelchair symbol. The access for wheelchairs or those who can't manage stairs, is by a little lift that is easily operated and fits a wheelchair and one person. Lovely view fr We didnt park Very straight forward to use the small lift just inside the door. Can fit one other person alongside a wheelchair. Clear instructions on the lift explaining how to operate it. Some tables have narrower isles but plent of them with room to sit a wheelchair in. table feet/legs were well under the midd Did not use the toilets. Staff were very helpful. Offering to look for a table, even though the pub was really busy. Even though you order at the bar the staff offered to take our order from the table. When we got up to leave a member of staff  went ahead and opened the door to the lift and made sure other customers moved o "
Tramway,"Tramway Great space for music. I’ve been in the Tramway before, but never for a concert. I was very impressed. I traveled by bus. The stops in both directions are a couple of hundred yards from the venue. There is plenty of on street parking and I think the venue has a car park. There is level access to the venue. Plenty of space to move around.
The viewing platform was easy to access and had room for four wheelchairs. There are plenty of toilets, the accessible ones are fairly small but manageable. They have thumb locks that I find hard to manage. All the staff were really helpful. On one of my (many) visits to the bar, I was told that the bar staff could come and get my order and then deliver my drinks, I declined but appreciated the offer.  Tramway Older venue but still excellent. Access to the venue and to the wheelchair spaces is good although the aisles do slope and require a little care.  excellent view of stage.  Disabled toilets are generally easy to get to, but if the audience is large the foyer can be a bit crowded.  Any deficiencies a Disabled parking at venue Easy access Spacious and reasonably easy to access.  Well kept and clean although possibly showing its age   Tramway A great exciting cool place with loads of good access. As part of BBC 6Music festival the tramway hosted the day events. I was lucky enough to go on the Sunday seeing a wide range of acts including Father John Misty. The venue was very accessible and inclusive! Got  a bus from city centre, bus stop about 100 meters from venue. There was a great emphasis on the accessibility, with ramps, lifts and no steps. See photographs Very cheerful, and one employee even went through the history of the building and garden whilst we were sitting and enjoying the garden. The disabled platform was good, and no questions were asked, we had a heavy night before and needed a sit down. There was no way of getting money within the venue, but you were told that when you arrived!"
Paesano Pizza,"Paesano Pizza Casual dining, relaxed space. Fantastic pizza, beautiful authentic ingredients and unobtrusive friendly service. The venue is in the heart of the city of Glasgow, near George Square and both Queen Street and Central Railway stations are well within a mile of Miller Street. Numerous bus routes pass by on adjacent streets. No designated disabled parking on Miller Street itself but again options are on adjacent s You enter via a large main door which opens towards you as you enter but there are no obstructions to accessing the reception area where you wait in a spacious area. The restaurant is lined with long tables but there is adequate access along all aisles and my table allowed me to push my wheelchair u N/A
Did not use during visit and did not ask about facilities. Excellent, friendly, attentive and very much in keeping with the relaxed ambience.  Paesano Pizza Paesano Pizza joint: An accessible review. Very small pizza place with not much room to manoeuvre but the amazing staff were a brilliant and managed to squeeze me in. Relied on street parking when I went. So it's your luck whether you find parking on the street or not. There's spaces all the way up the street. Around 15 Direct access into the front door is fine with no steps. Once inside it's very busy and quite tight. Both things can't be helped for such a small place in the city centre. No wheelchair accessible toilet Brilliant staff that found a way to squeeze into a table at the front. Telling a few people yo kindly move seat to give me enough room to manoeuvre. Very helpful and greatly appreciated. Great little pizza place with incredible pizza. Easily the best I've ever had and very cheap too. Strongly recommended although admittedly access is poor. Difficult to avoid considering it's size. Paesano Pizza Pizza A' Plenty. Delicious food, will go back! Limited amount of parking outside of the building due to where it is situated. Couldn't see any disabled parking at the entrance. Decent accessibility. Easy access into building, with no steps required to gain entry. In the restaurant there is wide enough passageways for a wheelchair to move about in. Toilets were easy enough to find as there was a sign indicating where they were. In the ladies toilet, there was an extra large toilet for anyone that needed extra space.  There were also separate disabled toilets that were well equipped. Staff were helpful and pleasant! Would recommend this place to others as the food was excellent, however the accessibility needs to be improved with the parking."
Glasgow Fort,"Glasgow Fort Glasgow Fort. Glasgow fort is an outdoor shopping complex with a cinema, restaurants and children's play areas. There is a large car park with a lot of access parking close to the front of the stores. The walkway around the complex is all on one level, and stores are at ground level on entering howe The first row of parking all the way around the complex has additional space blocked out on each side, allowing for car doors to be fully opened. 
Transport to this venue is fairly limited unless you would be driving, there are a few buses that do stop, however the bus stop is in the middle of the  I went to the venue by myself and I do not require disabled access, so I can't comment how how good the access was. I do feel that it could be made more accessible by signposting lifts and toilets more frequently. Also I find that the non-automatic doors could cause an issue to an individual unable  There is only one toilet facility that is not inside a shop or restaurant, and it is located in the middle of the complex, so  wouldn't say it is easily accessible to all. 

Marks and Spencer has accessible toilets with both right and left handed transfer rails and changing facilities in both the  The members of staff I spoke to were friendly, and asked me about my day.  Glasgow Fort Brilliant Place. The only reason for not giving the full marks as its outside and can be cold There is lots of car parking spaces here and a lot of buses goes here, Just be warned some none blue badges some times parks in the disabled spaces its all on the flat here There is only 1 disabled toilet within the park and its at the middle next to Zara, Asda has one inside the store, boots also has got one very good staff up the fort This is a outdoor shopping centre so can be cold at times Glasgow Fort Shopping Centre Accessibility Check. It was a very accessible visit to the shopping centre and to get around. Car park was very busy. 
Can get buses to and from the City Centre. There are lifts in the buildings that take you to the next level. There is a mobility point upstairs where you get the lift to and you just leave ID or a ten pound note with someone and get it back when you return the equipment. Very accessible lots of room. Very helpful. I would recommend it to other people and I have used this shopping centre many times."
House for an Art Lover,"House for an Art Lover Great service. Rolles and drinks very nice service  excellent  clean toilets  great  gardens and pictures  and fairy lights  made it pretty      House for an Art Lover Beautiful looking house in great setting. On paper visiting the House of an Art Lover seemed like it would be great. However, the experience on the ground was disappointing. Parking for blue badge holders was in a separate area of the car park where there were three or four bays - not sure exactly how many as the signs and lines on the ground were confusing. You didn't know quite where you were supposed to park. The stone edging around the car park was not the kindest w From the car park visitors are required to go down the stepped route or use the ramp which is quite a steep slope. Not great when you come to leave the building and climb back up to the car park. The odd use of kerb like stones at the foot of the ramp made nagotiating safe transit more difficult. Si The access to the accessible toilet was along a corridor with a ninety degree turn to go in the door. It was clean and tidy but not the easiest to move around in with a powerchair. Signage was not immediately obvious. Not very engaging and when asked for information it was the bare minimum that was given. Other staff we encountered did not appear too interested in our experience as visitors and customers. Worth visiting for the beautiful grounds and gardens. House for an Art Lover It is a house, but not just for Art Lovers!. level access in and out of the building, with designated disabled parking. Spacious enough inside to get around. Disabled parking bays in a designated area. Only sticking point may be the incline from the House to the spaces. Level access to and from the cafe and gift shop. There is a swing door to enter which is pretty heavy. May provide a problem for anyone with an upper body impairment. I didn't use the toilets. The staff were outstanding from start to finish. Could not do enough to make sure I was in a comfortable spot and that my access needs were catered for. I was here for a working lunch in the Cafe, so didn't have a look around the actual house."
Odeon Luxe,"Odeon Luxe Great cinema, visit every couple of weeks!. I love this cinema. It has the majority of wheelchair spaces either at the back of the screen, or very close to the back - no straining your neck like you have to do in most of the other cinemas nearby! I often transfer into the comfy reclining seats, whic Disabled parking bays are provided - there's quite a few right in front of the cinema and extra ones off to the side, in front of the hotel. 

Would be possible to get a bus to Paisley Road West and wheel into the Quay and to the cinema, but it's probably a 5-10 minute walk. There's a shortcut fro Very easy to get around. Just slightly trickier to self propel in the carpeted areas! The accessible toilet is nice and big, although occasionally needs cleaned a bit more frequently. Staff always seem friendly and helpful.  Odeon Luxe At the quay quite often thought we'd try here. The Odeon at the Quay has had a make over ... nice new seating ect ...only thing that hasn't improved is disabled access more so for wheelchair users .... having visited recently i was disappointed to find the placement of the chair spaces was right at  Parking at the quay is a complete farce  ....drop off points are curced so difficult to get the correct space to get the wheelchair in and out and to top it off selfish drivers using these drop off points to park meaning we have to actually go into the road to be dropped off ot picked up ....useless Pointless due to actual positioning 

Staff training would be helpfull as not all disabilities are the same

Use or bright lights and sound also not helpful for those with autism  Mostly the staff where ok if a bit uninterested and clueless Given the cost of refurbishment and the hike in tickets this was a missed opportunity by Odeon Odeon Luxe Ooh! Fancy Seats!. Part of the Odeon chain of cinemas, but this one has recently been refurbished, and is now an Odeon Luxe. The biggest difference being the fancy new seating, every single seat in every screen individually reclines making them very comfy, and they each have their own little table.  Travelling by car seems quite straightforward to this cinema, it shares a large car-park with other restaurants etc at the Quay, but there are many disabled parking spaces in front of the cinema.
There is also a 'drop-off' point directly outside.

It is possible to get there by public transport:  Please see main description All the toilets are located off the main foyer, clearly signed and easy to find.
There only appeared to be one accessible toilet, however it was extremely clean. 

There was fixed wall support to the left side (if on the toilet) and a moveable support on the right side. 
There was a dyson-style  Overall, all the staff seemed friendly and helpful. This included the staff in the Costa, within the cinema. Always useful to know - there's a cash machine right outside.

There are various restaurants at Glasgow Quay too, so could go for something to eat before/after film."
Braehead Arena,"Braehead Arena Ice Hockey - Purple Army!!. The Glasgow Clan (previously called Braehead Clan) are Glasgow professional ice-hockey team.

Their home is at the rink in Braehead Arena. 

It's an exciting game to watch... and you can follow the basics even if you've never been before. 
Suitable for the whole fami Have only ever travelled by car to Braehead. There are large (free) car parks, though these can still get quite busy, particularly at weekends.

There are many marked disabled bays, and their own security/parking team do inspect that these are used by blue-badge holders only.

There are buses to Standard seating can be booked online, and there is a phone-line for accessible seating.
Alternatively you can buy tickets in-person at the box office in Braehead -  this has limited opening times, see website.

You enter the arena  directly from the second floor of Braehead shopping centre (wher We didn't use them but there are accessible toilets.
Braehead shopping centre does also have a changing places toilet.. Which is why I've given it a high score We found everyone helpful.
From person I booked with on the phone, who checked what kind of seating we needed, to the staff there.

There are staff standing throughout the seating area before and during the game who will assist/direct anyone. This is a seasonal sport and mostly plays from around September to March.

The website of Glasgow Clan tells you the dates of all their games and whether they are home or away.

There isn't a discount for carers, so some people may need to consider this. 
Tickets are generally less than £20 eac Braehead Arena Worst experience. I won't be returning. First time there and won't return I am a white cane user and I asked
For assessable seating. Because of my mobility well they gave me my seats when I booked came to arena. They had put me in wheel chair pay not my fault staff was cheeky made me move all the w      Braehead Arena Access Review. Easy access from main entrance to the disabled seating with ramped access with a  great view to the main arena. The disabled parking is good at Braehead. You use their car park with plenty on the upper level, the lower level aswell as in the multi-storey Easy  access into and around the arena. I have only rated the toilets at 1 because i  know their is  one in the foyer but i haven't used it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. "
Bella Vita,"Bella Vita Italian. Authentic Italian restaurant. It is a well known Glasgow establishment. The restaurant is situated at the corner of Paisley Rd. West and the Moss Park Boulevard it is well served by a number of buses.
There is a large car park at the back of the premises. It has a step free entrance. I had no problem maneuvering inside, it had just opened for the evening so I was one of the first in. When I was leaving they had sat a lady in the wheelchair at a table near the door, which I was obviously going to have to pass to leave. I found this a bit strange, but  Large clean toilet. friendly and helpful A family friendly restaurant. Bella Vita Don't believe the hype. This being our 2nd visit ,the 1st time was ok , i have to say i couldn't wait to leave  this time... food took an eternity ... staff where unhelpfull and unapologetic for the poor service and even poorer quality of the  meal

We are both registered blind one of us is a whee In an awkward place at a junction parking not great as always busy / occupied Flatish surface ...bit cramped with tables  No staff where uninterested and not helpfull How this place is still open surprises me ...staff need educating abd a sence of humor Bella Vita Little bit of Italy!. We had a fantastic time in the restaurant from start to finish. It's not often a restaurant gets access, food and attitude right, but Bella Vita pulled it off. Lots of parking spaces at the rear of the restaurant. I believe there is also an accessible entrance at the rear, but I used the traditional entrance at the front of the building. It was almost 100% perfect for access. The entrance is entirely flat with a light doorway that I was able to manage easily. The table we had was set before we arrived. Although it was extremely busy, we were given a table for four with no seats, which made us very comfortable and had plenty of room. Fantastic and modern accessible loo in an extended part of the restaurant. A lot of care and attention has gone in to the accessible loo, showing it is not just an after thought. Very impressed! We were made extremely welcome by everyone from the table staff to the owner. We kept commenting on how the level of service made us feel like we were abroad. The owner came over to speak to us for a while too, which was very much appreciated. I will certainly visit again. Value for money wise it is fantastic."
Tesco Extra,Tesco Extra Disabled Parking in Tesco Silverburn. I have been a regular customer at Tesco since it opened. I am now a Blue Badge holder and try to use the disabled bays. This however is now problematical in this store. I frequently find the disabled spaces are full and many of the cars occupying them are not Bl      Tesco Extra Disabled parking. I am a blue badges holder don't know why tesco at silverburn has disabled bay's as u can't get parked in them  anyone can park in them. I complained & I was told by customer service they don't enforce people parking in them without blue badges      Tesco Extra Tesco's had a facelift. Superb parking and new layout is a lot more spacious and wheelchair friendly. There are just about as many accessible parking bays here as there are general bays (still difficult to get parked on busy days though so pick your shopping times wisely). It's level access from the car right throughout the building with everything on one level. Unknown as I did not use the toilets. Great staff that were very knowledgeable and pleasant (despite it being a Sunday afternoon!) 
TouchBase,"TouchBase Very accessible venue. As I'm sure you can imagine a facility run by Sense Scotland is very accessible. A lot of disability organizations use this place for obvious reasons. There is ample on street parking. Paisley Rd West is a short walk and is serviced by many bus routes Their accessible facilities include personal care resources, a passenger lift, grab rails, wide corridors and a contrasting decor. An induction loop is available on request. The building has many accessible toilets. The one I visited was very clean and roomy. The one negative was that the alarm cord was tied up. There were very helpful and there was a lot around in case you needed help. It has various rooms and event spaces of different sizes to accommodate most groups. TouchBase Fantastic changing facilities!. My daughter has a rare neurological syndrome and has a lot of different seizures every day, which can be triggered by almost anything. I feel apprehensive taking her anywhere just in case, but at Touchbase she is comfortable and stimulated.  All the facilities at Touchbase are really accessible and fantastic. The toilet facilities are brilliant - so spacious, well equipped and comfortable. They are always so clean and stocked with baby wipes and cleaning products. They are great for any age so hopefully as my daughter grows, I can continue to take her to Touchbase and not worry about accidents/changing e All the staff at Touchbase so lovely and helpful, "
Travelodge Glasgow Queen Street,"Travelodge Glasgow Queen Street Easily accessible. Everything went very smoothly, no problems re accessibility. There are parking bays on the street that can be used for free with a Blue Badge. However, being the city centre, it’s very busy and they were often all taken up. There is discounted (via the hotel) parking in the NCP Glasshouse car park in Glassford Street a block or so away. Glasgow City Councils  Ramp and large doors to get in and out of the hotel. There’s a narrow corridor to the lifts with doors at each end which was a wee bit tricky to navigate with a mobility scooter - definitely needed help to hold the doors open. The lifts are large enough for a scooter and there’s lots of room to mano In the cafe/bar, there’s a manually operated lift to the lower floor for the accessible loo. All good. All very helpful and accommodating. I hired my mobility scooter and they let the hire company deliver it 3 days ahead of our visit, and let me leave it with them when we left for the company to pick up the next day. Being in the heart of Merchants City, this hotel is great for access to the city centre. The St Enoch Centre, which is fully accessible, is a short distance away, as is the also fully accessible Princes Square with its Everyman Cinema, not to mention the busy Argyle Street and Buchanan Street. I had Travelodge Glasgow Queen Street A pleasant surprise. We stayed here overnight in one of the hotels accessible rooms. I cannot recomend it highly enough.

The hotel also has evacuation chairs in the case of a fire, I’ll be back!!! Thank you Travellodge!! ??"

Security met us at back door and took us through the side of the stage along the front of stage and then at side of stage. We had an awesome.view..Security very attentive and John (his name) very very friendly. After gig escort Got dropped off at back You are brought in through the back door but are rewarded with a cracking view of band.. Did not use John was awesome. Like our.own personal security Hassle free venue for disabled. The Garage The Night has just begun!. Nightclub Garage on Sauchiehall Street is a great spot for a good night out with friends and is also is a very inclusive environment for everyone. After some digging, I was told that the nightclub offers various access routes to wheelchair users into the venue. 
Firstly,  There isn't close by parking near The Garage nightclub so would probably suggest taking a taxi to avoid a long walk to the club. Despite not having access to the upstairs attic, there are still many rooms accessible for wheelchair users which is great to get a taste of Glasgow nightlife. In a nightclub, it is very good to half wheelchair access to the toilet next to the G2 room. The staff and bouncers in Garage were very pleasant and approachable. "
intu Braehead,"intu Braehead Intu Braehead Shopping Centre Review. Intu Braehead Shopping Centre is an excellent choice to go for your shopping as it provides an array of shops of all styles and has friendly staff happy to help. It makes shopping easier especially at this time of year when Scottish weather isn’t pleasant as it’ There are plenty of disabled parking spaces available in all of the car parks at Braehead. There are various car parks around the centre for easy access to certain parts of the centre. Access to the shopping centre is as easy for wheelchair users as it is for non-wheelchair users. There are two floors of the centre which you can venture between using one of the elevators available. Additionally there are plenty of seats available to stop and have a rest. All of the individual shop There are various toilets located around the centre and there are disabled toilets present at each set. The clean and tidy toilets have lots of space to manoeuvre and have grab rails. There is also enough room for a carer in each. Every member of staff are always happy to help with any problems, for example providing a scooter if required.  intu Braehead Accessible shopping trip. Great shopping centre with lots of choice for stores to visit. I travelled by public transport, which was very easy. The bus stop was in the main car park of Braehead. The shopping centre itself wasn't too busy and had lots of room to move around. There were lots of lifts available and wheelchairs to borrow if needed. Lots of toilets available which were accessible. Had everything I needed. Always found staff very friendly in Braehead. Especially the mobility staff members. I would recommend Braehead as it's very accessible. Quieter during the week and can get busy at weekends. Getting parked can be difficult at weekends."
Drygate,"Drygate Great access friendly staff.Dog—friendly, child friendly Gastropoda with two restaurant areas.  Ground floor  open kitchen restaurant and Brewhouse less formal area for pub grub .venue has function area , beer garden and the best loos I’ve encountered for disabled customers recently.

Everyman Cinema,"Everyman Cinema Brilliant venue. I’ve just got back from seeing a film there tonight. The staff couldn’t be more helpful. I was able to ride my mobility scooter into the auditorium and park it there before walking to my seat. Food and drink served at your very comfy seat or sofa is a bonus!

WEST Brewery,"WEST Brewery The West is Best. I cannot believe that I have lived in Glasgow all my life & just discovered this place.  Food is fantastic, atmosphere is calm and relaxed, lots of space and cannot wait to return!  

Excellent access (only slight issue was very small step at end of ramp, could manage it fine in       WEST Brewery Good Food. Access & Toilets. West was a place I loved before my injury so first trip after leaving hospital had to be here.  There is a ramp up to the door.  2 negatives here.  A small kerb to get on the ramp and the doors are heavy so you do need help to open.  Staff were welcoming and moved chairs Took a taxi.  There is parking outside and on Glasgow Green but not sure about disabled places.    "
Clober Farm,"Clober Farm Freedom For A Few Nights. This fully accessible accommodation sleeps 6 people and is run by Spinal Injuries Scotland. It is fantastic for wheelchair users. There are 2 parking spaces right outside Clober Farm at the front door, this means that it is easier for wheelchair users to get access to the house. Especially if the weather is bad.

Due to not knowing about this area of Glasgow I can’t really comment on the public transport, however there was a The front door at Clober Farm is opened electronically by using a key fob card outside and an automatic button on the inside. The front door is very wide for a wheelchair user to get through and the accommodation is all level access.

The living room and kitchen area are open spaced meaning that i There are two toilets in Clober Farm, a bathroom and an en-suite shower room that is connected to the bedroom with the ceiling tracking hoist. Both are very spacious for wheelchair users, there is an adjustable sink and an emergency red cord freely hanging beside the toilet in both.

In the shower With Clober Farm being self-catering accommodation, we didn’t really encounter any staff members, however a staff member from Spinal Injuries Scotland, Donnamarie met us when we first arrived and when we were leaving. She was very welcoming, friendly and helpful with showing us around the accommodat I would definitely recommend staying at Clober Farm, especially if you are a wheelchair user because the accessibility of the house is great. I will hopefully be visiting again soon.


You can read my blog post here: http://www.ajourneyinmywheels.org/2018/10/04/my-stay-at-clober-farm-in-glasgow/. Clober Farm Superb for wheelchair users. Fully accessible living accommodation and accessible garden with patio area and raised beds, specifically designed for wheelchair users. The open plan kitchen/living area has patio doors leading to the garden.

There are three bedrooms, two of which are wheelchair acce There are 2 spaces at the front door. We did not use public transport so cannot comment. Level access throughout the property. Assistive technology to control blinds, lights etc. Press pad entry at main door and into both accessible bedrooms. Lovely garden with raised beds and ramped wooden summer house. Spacious wet room with height adjustable wash hand basin. Good turning space. Choice of 2 shower chairs. Grab rails at shower, sink and toilet. No staff at the property but Spinal Injusries Scotland staff very helpful when booking. A quiet, restful holiday in a lovely farm conversion. If only more places had tracking hoists and truly accessible shower rooms like Clober. There's plenty to see and do in the area. Glasgow is only a few miles away  and has accessible itineraries on VisitScotland's website."
IKEA,"IKEA Just as expected. The cafe very large and spacious so it's easy to get about in a wheelchair.  In the upstairs room displays, most would not be large enough to access in a powerchair or larger manual chair, but I did manage to get in and around a few displays. This is understandable since they are s  Wide automatic doors into the building.
T-loops for hearing aids were advertised at the checkouts but wasn't switched on/wasn't working The disabled toilets were of average size and the red cords were hanging freely
It would be excellent to see a changing place toilet installed.   IKEA Shopping with the clan. Amazing access from the moment you leave the car. Fantastic! Plenty of spaces with lots of room to get in and out the car. Very spacious Lift, the store itself is very spacious and has an arrow system to how you the direction to make your way through the store. Again, very spacious. The only issue is that they are at the end of the store so it is quite a trip from one end of the building to the other. Always willing to help and assist. My only concern is that it can be quite difficult to find a member of staff at times! "
Barolo Grill,"Barolo Grill good food. We were met at the door by a very friendly member of staff. As I had booked and arrived in my wheelchair he knew who I was. He greeted me by name and showed me to my table.
Nice big spacious restaurant, fully wheelchair accessible. A few different seating arrangements including booths an There is on street parking outside. There is a large NCP car park across the road. Because it's in the center of Glasgow transport links are good. No steps to enter. When I arrived a member of staff held the door for me. Moving around inside was no problem. Fantastic large clean toilet. Staff were very helpful and attentive. I really enjoyed my meal but the person with me didn't think it was great, but okay. That could've been done to their choices. Barolo Grill Good value, good food, good service.This I have to say was a real find when I first visited and did so again last week with the specific task of reviewing in mind. It can be a real positive when somewhere you visit doesn’t change. You know what you are going to get and have the satisfaction that it  Did not use any parking but informed It was widely available and accessible. Only 5 mins from Glasgow Queen Street and Central stations. Bus stops outwith the pedestrian used area. One one level both inside the restaurant and it’s outside seating area. Fully accessible, equipped and spacious for a chair and carer well serviced and clean. Exceptional in welcome and friendly, recognised my cane and offered assistance in direction to a seated table, moved the table to assist sitting, offered a table with more direct light if needed, gave description and explanation of menu choice, on leaving tha same attention was given offer of transp Good service, quality and food as service as said earlier, could not fault it looking forward to going back soon."
Scotland Street School Museum,"Scotland Street School Museum I Spy Scotland Street School. I haven't been here for years, but after a great day out, certainly keen to go back.

In an original school building (designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), the museum gives information about the history of schooling/education and Glasgow's culture.

You can walk t There is a multi-storey car park directly opposite the school, and just beside that is an underground station (shields road).

Buses also are in this area, but we didn't use them. For an old and historic building, access was really good.
The front doors have a push-button and then open themselves. The entrance is flat.

When inside, there are ramps wherever there are a few steps, and there is a lift to go to the different floors.

Corridors are all wide, and I think acce The accessible toilet was ok. Pretty standard facilities.
 Think this area could probably be improved/smartened up, but I would say the same about the other toilets too.
Was disappointed to see the emergency cord was tied up in a knot so couldn't be used, especially when it already had a Euans Gui Staff we came across were helpful and knowledgeable. They seemed to want to make sure we got the most from our visit. 
Due to there being a special event on, there were children running around, doing various activities, staff were encouraging their enthusiasm.

When we visited there were other pe There are lots of reasons to visit Scotland Street School. Fans of Macintosh will enjoy seeing the building itself and learning about his work.
It's interesting to find about the history of education, to see how things used to be done, or to reminisce (& feel old!!)

It's a hands-on experience, a Scotland Street School Museum Good venue. There were automatic doors at the entrance with a ramp access. There was an elevator to all floor. Some wide doorways. Signs and pictures were accessible to most. Accessible toilets. There was only one small section with stairs only access but this did not affect the overall experience.  There was a car park across the street from the museum. There was a pedestrian crossing. Several ramps available. An elevator leading to each floor. Wide door ways  Friendly and nice. "
Partick Railway Station,"Partick Railway Station Let the Train Take the Strain!. Patrick Train Station is one of the bigger stations as you journey from the West into Glasgow from Helensburgh or Balloch lines. 
You can also travel from Milngavie to here. Or continue East to Edinburgh or Airdrie. 

It is one where the majority of trains stop, so I guess most people at Partick Train Station will be planning to travel by train!

There is a car park just outside with a pay-and-ride scheme, but the car park does tend to get pretty full pretty quickly. There is also a carpark for Morrisons Supermarket just next to it but you can only park ther Just for the station itself, and not the actual train:

From the platforms you go into the building - flat entrance, automatic doors. 
Inside, there are several bench type seats. 
At one end there is the lift, this is signposted. Lift seems reasonable size and could fit power wheelchair plus car There is an accessible toilet just beside the stations main entrance door. It does have a sign on the door, but otherwise I didn't think it was overly obvious it was there - when I asked, staff happily pointed it out.

It opens with a radar key, but if you ask the staff they will open it for you i Although I haven't required any assistance for access needs, whenever I have talked to staff or made any other enquiries they have been approachable and helpful. While a good hub for onward travel, there are quite a few things to explore nearby Partick itself - Byres Road (well known Street of 'student' /independent shops), Kelvingrove Park, Kelvingrove Museum, Hunterian Museum, Glasgow University etc Partick Railway Station Partick Railway Station. Partick is a busy interchange station on the lines west from Glasgow Central and Queen Street. Trains go east to Glasgow, Airdrie and Edinburgh, west to Dalmuir, Balloch and Helensburgh, and north to Milngave and Cumbernauld. There is a subway entrance in the station buildin There is a station car park at the side of the station. You also park at Morrison's car park but there is a 2 hour time limit, there are lots of buses as the bus station is next to the train station. Access to both platforms is by lift to a spacious waiting area, the ramp can be booked or you can ask for help when you get there. there is a disabled toilet next to the ticket office you have to ask staff for the key. staff are helpful & friendly. we especially like the guy who stands on the platform announcing the trains! Good station to explore Glasgow's west end from. lots of shops cafes & museums."
Café Fame,"Café Fame Lovely Art Deco Cafe. Great cafe in the heart of Glasgow city centre with a friendly atmosphere, attentive staff and wheelchair accessible. Lovely selection of food and drinks. Vegan options available. We parked on St Vincent Street which was only a 2 min walk to the cafe. We were able to park for free with our blue badge. There was a very small step into the cafe, but it was very easy for my heavy powered wheelchair to get up/down. The door was open so even if I was on my own I would have been able to get in without any problems. 

Inside the cafe was very spacious and I was able to move around easily between table I didn't use the toilet, but I was told by the owner that there is one. The next time I visit this cafe I'll try check out the toilet. I'll give this 4 stars just because I haven't actually seen the toilet yet. The staff was fantastic. I only seen one staff member who I believe is the owner. He was very friendly, attentive and made us feel welcome. He helped move chairs for me to get into the table and I found him very helpful and understanding. I'd definitely recommend this cafe to others looking for a lovely cafe to grab some food or something to drink while in the city. It's great for everyone whether with friends and family or having a business meeting. Its the perfect spot. I will definitely visit again soon. Café Fame Nice Spacious Café 2 minutes from Central Station. A nice place to have a sandwich in the city center. Plenty of space for wheelchair and ground level access. Easy to park in Bothwell street (I believe it's free for blue badge holders) and walk round the corner to the café on Hope Street. Street level access. Disabled toilet. Friendly staff and owners. From the café it's an easy stroll to the Buchanan Street shopping area and to Central Station."
Purrple Cat Cafe,"Purrple Cat Cafe My favourite destination. I have been visiting the Purrple Cat Cafe for many years and I have never had any accessibility issues. All visits, including those for special occasions or the regular events such as ""Bingo with Cats"" or ""Craft Club"" are fully accessible. There is only one toilet and it is There is a bus stop just outside the cafe and one just down the street on Gallowgate. As a wheelchair user, I use my car and with my blue badge can park on Gallowgate without charge. The signage may be a little small, personally I would like it bigger than any other sign but that is just me. However, once you know the sign, it is relatively easy to see from a distance down Argyle Street, Gallowgate or Saltmarket/High Street.
There is a small ramp into the building and because i One disabled toilet for everyone. There is no room for others and due to listed status this cannot be changed. This is not really a problem though. The toilet has grab rails and a red cord. There is plenty of space for moving around with or without footplates, which is a bonus. It is not a changing  The Staff are wonderful, after all they all love cats. They are always ready to answer questions on any subject and they are a living wage employer. The staff come from all over the UK and Europe and they go above and beyond anything you might need to help. Hand gel is available on every table and before going into the cafe in the small vestibule. Masks are optional at this time but when they were compulsory, they were worn whenever moving around the cafe. When you were sat at your table, you could remove the mask. 
I will be going again this week and Purrple Cat Cafe The Purple Cat Cafe Glasgow. I visited the café with a friend and overall had a really great, memorable time! There is level access at the main door, throughout the café area and into the toilet. There is a wide path running through the middle of the café with access to chairs / sofas at various hei We walked from Central Station for around 15 minutes to get there. There was a lot of uneven surfaces on the way there although the payment around the entrance was clear and flat. The building is positioned on a corner therefore the entrance is not immediately obvious when coming from the direction of Argyle St and the sign could be a little larger (you can't see it from a distance) however you know you are in the right place as it has a picture of a purple cat sipping tea on I could not see any signs for the toilet however staff point it out when you first arrive. There is one toilet with flat access and a wide door. The whole establishment appears to be very clean and tidy. They are very friendly, attentive and eager to introduce you to the cats! They will go over a few ground rules when you first arrive. The food was served faster than in any café I'd been to before. There are hand-gel bottles located throughout the premises, one at the entrance and one on each table. Masks are worn by all staff and customers (except when they are eating). All customers were well spaced apart although they would occasionally wander around to pet the cats (whilst wearing masks). "
City Sightseeing Glasgow,"City Sightseeing Glasgow A great sight seeing tour but dependent on how good your driver and guide are.5* for the parts of the tour led by Jon the driver and Dominic the guide. Another driver was charmless and even sped past people waiting to board. I would recommend you do the tour with live guide. Commented tour is best f On street parking or usual city centre parks. If you have a car start your tour at the Museum of Transport where there is ample free parking. The bus driver folded out a ramp. Plenty of room to drive my Go-Go Sport on and park in the disabled space. My scooter is 44inches, there was still room for a standard wheelchair to sit besid it. Not applicable. Jon, driver and Dominic, guide, were superb. A great way to visit city centre attractions without the hassle of parking. City Sightseeing Glasgow Informative and easy for me. As a visually impaired person I found the tour to be a great way to discover Glasgow Pretty easy to go from Queen Street station and find the bus in George Square. For me it was Ok and some buses had ramps and a wheelchair space. Hopping on and off there were some buses without any obvious ramp - could be a problem for wheelchair users to know what buses work for them. Not directly applicable but plenty of the venues on the tour were very accessible and had accessible loos. Excellent staff, great tour descriptions and help knowing where to get off the bus and directions to the venues. Easy way to get around Glasgow and find places for me - could be hard work for wheelchair users"
ibis Styles Glasgow Centre West,"ibis Styles Glasgow Centre West Stylish and Comfortable hotel. Wheelchair Accessible hotel, on the level facilities on ground floor for drinking, breakfast and being social. Variety of seats at different levels. Tables with integrated electric plugs for your devices.
Palacial accessible bedrooms with Queen sizes beds, massive bat There is some on street parking at the side of the hotel but it is very expensive during the day. Try to find out position for blue badge holders. Free from 6 pm to 8 am.
Hotel has deals with various car parks but prices vary. Watch out for dedicated cycle way  between pavement and road.
Waterloo  Level access from street to ground floor, wide electric doors. Lifts light but not spacious probably adequate for wheelchairs.
Doors to rooms are very heavy. Ask on booking about accessible rooms. Very well equipped with grab rails, red cord alarms etc.

Found bedside lights up and sliding switch Loo on ground floor not used. Welcoming and friendly. This is a new hotel Oct 2018. On the whole it was effortless to use as a disabled customer.
I particularly liked the Matt floor coverings in the bathrooms and carpeting throughout.
The breakfast was self service, there is a bar, coffee shop but limited food during the day.

Parking on the street ibis Styles Glasgow Centre West Accessible. Hotel accessible throughout, friendly helpful staff on hand to assist Hotel located at the end of Waterloo Street about a quarter of a mile from Central train station.
I walk slowly and it took 15 minutes Automatic doors, level entrance into reception, bar and breakfast area.  Lift to rooms.  Disabled room had a heavy door, access onto bed by wheelchair was from one side only.  There was 2 red cords in the room and 2 red cords in the accessible toilet, with a great shower with seat and 4 grab rails.  As above Friendly helpful and efficient Great city centre location with level access to it from nearby  central train station 
We will be using this hotel again."
Sichuan House,"Sichuan House Great Asian food in city centre location. Had two courses and drinks at this restaurant. Saw online some good deals and was very pleased with disabled access. I came on wheels so unsure about public transport or parking situation on Sauchiehall street. To get in there is one glass door that opens inwards. Turn right and you will be seated by staff. When entering a chair was moved from a table instantly and everything was smooth. One star off just because of the door being heavy I could not open this independently. Well signposted, I sat very close to them but did not feel pushed to the side. Made for a very comfortable experience. Red cord was not hanging to floor but I fixed this and told manager I did so they were thankful when I explained. Very clean. There was not a lot of turning space but enough room fo So helpful and nice. One man read out the main menu to us when he noticed I was reading out everything to my visually impaired friend. They also asked if I needed anything cut up further or drinks poured from bottle to glass. Highly recommend if you are looking for dinner in Glasgow City Centre. Sichuan House Accessible, great food, lovely service, no fuss. We didn't expect much but needed something to eat in a place that, at least, looked accessible, We were pleasantly surprised to find the interior of Sichuan House to be roomy enough for a wheelchair and for the accessible loo to be convenient and real This restaurant is on Sauchiehall Street so I presume that parking is challenging. Public transport is ok, just not to the door. Charing Cross station is nearby and loads of buses nearby too. Easy to get in, to get around inside and to get to the loo. Accessible, just like it should be! Easy to reach too - close by the main eating area and not miles away down a corridor. Lovely, friendly and efficient service. Try it! It's been there forever so we were surprised at how accessible it was, Lots of Chinese people were eating there so that would seem to be an added recommendation in terms of the food."
Village Glasgow,"Village Glasgow Excellent room facilities, pool could do better. Had a two night stay here. The accessible room was one of the best I've stayed in. The room is really big, with lots of room to move around. Unlike a LOT of hotel rooms, there was a  wide enough passage way to the door, which enabled my husband to ope Easy to drive there and lots of free parking. It is level from the car park, into the hotel. Not sure about public transport Good throughout the hotel, except in the pool. There is no hoist in the pool. There are graded steps in, which have a rail. There is a disabled shower in the pool but it's a bit of a weird set up. I suppose you could go back to your room to get dressed. Large accessible toilet in the reception. Plenty space to move around. Staff were helpful but not pushy The entire lower area is on one level, with a lift to the upper floors. Plenty of space to move around the entire hotel. One of the best accessible rooms we have been in with lots of space and a huge bathroom, with wet floor shower. Easy access to Glasgow by car, taxi. 

Nice quirky decor. And the Village Glasgow Fantastic place all round. I go to The Village every time I visit Glasgow now, it is ideal for gigs at the SSE Hydro. I haven’t actually stayed in the hotel but I would definitely choose it if I were to stay in Glasgow. It had fantastic accessibility, helpful and friendly staff, and great food. There are 15 clearly marked disabled parking bays at the front entrance, each has lines to the side and front. There are signs up to show these areas. The website says it is close to train stations and bus stops There are various spaces for eating and drinking, a Starbucks, a seating area where you can still order food from the bar and eat in. The seats are tables are very low here though so not ideal. In the bar I am able to negotiate my way around without much difficulty, the tables are a good height but  There is an accessible toilet in the foyer which is easy to get in and out off. It is quite long, there is space to turn, there’s a call button and red cord. There are grab rails and its always clean and tidy The staff here are so helpful and friendly. The make you feel relaxed and welcome, are polite and seem to work well together I love The Village and would definitely recommend it. On my last visit, the fire alarm went off. There was a fire exit just a few feet away which was opened and staff calmly and politely led customers out. Straight away a team of staff had yellow vests on and had everyone next to the bike shed in th"

Only thing is the ramp at the entrance from the street is quite steep, but manageable for me. Free disabled parking spaces at the back of the building.      Millennium Hotel Glasgow Fantastic location with great access!. Great hotel right next to queen street station. Couldn't be more central. Staff were so helpful nothing was a issue for them. First hotel I've been in that actually went through a PEEP (fire evacuation plan) which I thought was great and made me feel very comfo Not sure on the parking but if you left Queen Street station via the George  Square exit as you come down the ramp there is a push pad door in your left which takes into the hotel. Best place to stay if you want to be In the city centre and are taking. The train. Taxis could also pick up and drop of As stated the accessible room was perfect. The reception area was all flat and the lifts went to all floors. The toilet in the room wasn't a good size plenty room to move around in and park next to the toilet to do a sliding transfer. Plenty of grab rails. The toilets at reception area also a good size and has a passcode to get  into which stops everyone from using it. All extremely helpful as stated before regarding the extension cable they sorted the issue very quickly. A guy on reception called Raymond was particularly friendly and helpful. They were great going over the PEEP and booking taxis etc for us. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
Celino's Partick,"Celino's Partick Tasty foods. You enter via a very well stocked deli which has a great range of meats, cheeses, wine and lots of Italian treats.
The restaurant is quite tight with seating but I was still able to manage moving around in my electric wheelchair. This staff were very helpful in getting me a suitable tab Parking is very difficult in Glasgows west end but my father has a blue badge and found a accessible parking spot just around the corner.
I traveled by bus from the city center, Dumbarton Road is very well servred bus route. Accessible entrance, seating is fairly tight but you can get about. Nice clean accessible toilet The staff we are very helpful finding the suitable suitable space. Just lovely tasty foods Celino's Partick Everything for everyone or ""Tutto per tutti"" as they say in Celino's in this accessible restaurant.A wheelchair accessible restaurant that has friendly staff and delicious food. We were dropped off just outside the restaurant. There were no dedicated disabled parking bays close by but there is a quiet street just to the side which we used to unload/load into our WAV.  There are a number of bus stops close by.  Partick train station is a 5/10 minute walk away with links to t Signage is clear. There is a large (and heavy) glass paned wooden door at the entrance which is unautomated but there are plenty of staff available to help.  No lips or stairs to entry way.  Level access to main part of restaurant past the deli counter.  We were seated at table 16, a table for 2, si Accessible loo on the lower level of the restaurant.  We didn't use it on this visit but I know from visiting before that it's not too small and will allow access for an electric wheelchair but probably not enough room to turn around in. Staff were great.  As mentioned before, they didn't interrupt us too many times even though it was a ""quiet"" Tuesday night.  We asked for a break after our mains before looking at the dessert menu.  We didn't have to ask again for the menu (as has happened before in other restaurants) but whilst we  Yes I would recommend it to other people.

People's Palace Museum,"People's Palace Museum Collection of local life artefacts and glass houses.Very accessible museum of everyday glasgow life, great cafe and places to sit indoors and out. I went on the ""Hop on Hop off"" bus (minus the hopping). There was ample on street parking around the green. Very roomy exhibition space, ample circulation for power chair or scooter. Lift to all floors. There was a TV in reception giving information in sign and lip speaking. Lots of room to turn.. All rails in place. Red cord fine. The only toilet I have seen with their own prominent red cord sign. Everyone I encountered was very welcoming and accommodating (if you have read my other reviews you will see I am trying to improve on ""friendly and helpful"". Make this your coffe stop.

Burger King,"Burger King Burger King in Buchanan Galleries. This Burger King is on the second floor of the Buchanan Galleries next to the lifts and toilets.

On second floor of Buchanan galleries. There are two lifts to get up there. Open plan food court style. Lots of seating available. To the left of the Burger King there is a door with a pushpad on the left of the door. Pressing this takes you to the outside of two wheelchair accessible toilets!

We were given plenty of time to order as we couldn't make our minds up. The staff offered to Accessible loos are right next door. Really helpful "
Radisson Blu Hotel Glasgow,Radisson Blu Hotel Glasgow City centre hotel. The Radisson Blu is in the centre of Glasgow.  It's right next to Central Station and handy for lots of buses. Theres no parking at the hotel but you can park at a nearby NCP carpark  for a reduced rate of £15 a night. Just take your ticket to the Hotel Reception.  Flat entrance i Beside Central Station so ideal for trains and loads of buses nearby. No parking at hotel but you can get a reduced rate of £15  a night at nearby NCP carpark. Flat entrance to hotel. Revolving door but an ordinary one beside it. Staff were very quick to come and help us. Lifts to all floors. Wide corridors I've taken half a star off as the toilet in the bedroom was quite low down and only had a grab rail on one side. Incredibly helpful  Radisson Blu Hotel Glasgow Glasgow raddison. Great hotel. Great location. Accessible room is big enough but not as large as the one at the Millennium.     
Clyde Community Hall,Clyde Community Hall Fantastic Venue for the Community. This is a fantastic venue to hold an event in or a club/group. Plenty of Buses come from various locations along Paisley Road West and also Govan Road. There is also a Subway Station around about 10mins walk away.  There is an accessible Loo at this centre and it has plenty of room to move around in and a low sink to use. Very friendly staff and always on hand if you need help.

Pizza Punks,"Pizza Punks Awesome pizza and wheelchair accessible. This was my second time at this awesome pizza place. Wheelchair accessible via a portable ramp, accessible loo, friendly staff and of course, AMAZING PIZZA! We drove here but we parked a few mins walk from the restaurant in West George Street. I'm not sure exactly about public transport, but it is near Central Station. There are a few steps into the restaurant but there is a portable ramp that the staff put down. Inside the restaurant is really spacious and I had room to move around in my wheelchair without feeling restricted. The staff made sure I felt comfortable. I found the tables were at a good height for my  There is an accessible toilet next to the bar. The other toilets are downstairs. On my first visit to this restaurant, it was very busy so it made getting through the small bar area a little difficult as there were lots of people standing. The toilet door opens out into the bar so if it's really bus Both visits staff were very friendly and welcoming. I love this awesome pizza restaurant and it has the best vegan pizza too. Lots of different pizza options as well as a 'create your own' which you can add as many toppings as you want at no extra cost. UNLIMITED TOPPINGS!

Walk here. Not sure about transport. Large space with plenty of tables and chairs of different sizes. All on one floor. Pity about the 20cm front step. Great accessible loo on ground level. Clean and tidy. Very friendly and helpful staff - one staff member was really helpful and pointed out that there was an 'accessible toilet' if I didn't fancy going downstairs. I had the Go Greek pizza which was really swell and was washed don really nicely by a Chieftain IPA."
Òran Mór,"Òran Mór Play a pie and a pint. It does what it says on the tin! It’s an afternoon showing of a play, and you get a pint and a pie of your choice. It’s a nice way to spend an afternoon.
The venue is in the basement that can be accessed by Lift. Being in the heart of the West End it is fairly easy to get there . I got there by bus from the city centre, the buses are every 10 minutes. Hillhead subway station is a few hundred yards away, although it was opened in 1896, and is the third-oldest underground rail transit system in Europe,  to the At the front of the venue there are a number of steps, obviously not accessible to myself. There are no notices at the front of the venue but because I’ve been here before I knew you had to enter via the Brasserie restaurant around the corner where you can get lift access to all floors. There are al There are no signs for the accessible toilet, I had to ask a member of staff. There are a number of tight turns to get to the toilet but it is manageable.
It’s not the cleanest toilet I’ve ever been in but was acceptable. There was a red cord in the toilet just not beside the system. All the staff are very helpful. There is no access at the front door, the lift is very small and at points it’s tight for space. Although my review shows that the access is a challenge you have to keep in mind the building is hundreds of years old, so they wouldn’t have expected a clumsy oaf like myself driving about in an electri Òran Mór Dinner and a gig. This was my first visit to this venue as a wheelchair user. Having read a bad review els where I was a little concerned however I need not have been. The food was good and the band even better! I will definitely be back. I had no difficulty parking near to venue. There is a disabled bay across the road outside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens on Queen Margaret Drive and two bays outside the library on Byres Road a short distance away. However you have to bear in mind this was a Sunday evening in a very busy park  The venues' website states to use the Brasserie entrance on Great Western Road. A member of staff came over immediately and directed us to the lift which took us up to the main bar where we had booked a table. The lift was big enough for me and 3 friends and was easy to get in and out of. Once in th There are two accessible loos, one on the second floor that I didn't visit and one in the basement as you come out of the lift before going through a security door into the music venue. The loo door was okay to open, not too heavy and there was plenty of space to maneuver the chair around. There wer All of the staff were helpful, polite and friendly. I cannot fault them in anyway. I would recommend other wheelchair users to go out have a meal and see a band at this venue.

Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the bar, but this is A spacious well equipped accessible toilet just off the main reception area. The staff at the tennis club are outstanding. They are so very welcoming to everyone who walks through the door.

Waterstones,"Waterstones Waterstones on Sauchiehall Street. You could spend hours in this bookstore looking for a new read or relaxing in one of the two cafes. Unsure about public transport & parking near Sauchiehall Street. Level access in and plenty space around tables for powerchairs to maneovre. To get to the lift and till on ground floor this is a slight incline (no handrails) which might be a bother for some. Alternatively, two steps with handrails. Signage was very clear for what floor has what genres of books, a I used the accessible toilet on the Lower Ground floor next to the cafe. (There is another next to the Cafe Bar on the top floor but I didn’t use this). The cafe one is through one door which was quite heavy and then you have to turn left/ do a U turn to get into the toilet. Plenty space inside for  Spoke to staff at the tills, on the floor and at the cafe, all so nice and helpful. Offered to carry things and pack my bag without making a big deal of everthing.

Apple Store Good access and plenty of toys to play with!. Externally it's not obvious where the store is. Look for the Apple sign above the door. A ramp runs parallel to the building and takes you to the front door. Once inside there is plenty of space and everything is presented at reasonable heights for you t The store is in a pedestrianised Street. It is close to several bus stops, Central Station and Queen Street station. Once inside the store everything was easy to see and get to. There are plenty of staff offering to help if required. A spacious lift takes you to the first level.  The staff were excellent. Offering to help and demonstrate the Apple products. The idea of staff carrying portable card reading machines and dealing with purchases was great - no high counters to negotiate of fixed card readers.

Kelvingrove Park,"Kelvingrove Park Puddles in the Park!. Glasgow is known as  the 'Dear Green Place,' with Kelvingrove being one of its many parks.
Around the river Kelvin, in the West end of the city, this is a lovely big park.
Today I visited on a rainy, dreich (miserable), March afternoon, so it wasn't looking at its best. Some sp In the city centre, there are various transport options.
The nearest underground is Kelvin subway station (on Byres Road), about a 5 minute walk away.
The nearest train station is Patrick, about a 15-20 minute walk away.
There are lots of buses in Glasgow,and even the tourist hop-on hop-on bus stops Much of the park is pretty accessible; with wide, smooth, paved paths. 
There are various entrances from streets at different sides of the park, all the ones I went to had flat entrances on one level - no steps.
The park is big, and you can select the routes best for you. You can get from one end to On the map it indicates that there is an accessible toilet in the park. I did not use this so cannot comment further.
However, you are also very near to Kelvingrove Museum, which has several accessible toilets. N/A - it is a public park and not staffed Don't let the weather in my pictures put you off!! It is a lovely park, last time I visited was in the summer (for Mela Festival), it was hot, sunny and all the flowers were in bloom.
The park is used as a venue for events and festivals at times through the year.
Visit the surrounding area while you Kelvingrove Park Glasgow Mela 2018. Join the colour, music and atmosphere of this multi-cultural  festival!

Centred in Kelvingrove Park, the festival overflows into streets in the surrounding area, particularly Byres Road.

It is free, and everyone is welcome. It is generally busy to park as it's in city of Glasgow, and this is a popular event. There will be spaces, but you may need to drive about to find them!
There were some disabled parking spaces outside the Park, at the neighbouring Kelvingrove Museum, and in the streets in the area.
Some of these  The main paths of the Park are accessible for wheelchairs and scooters; they are wide and paved. 
There are some hills in the park, which could need some effort if self-propelling a manual chair, most of the hills could be avoided though and there would still be a variety of routes to follow.

Fo There were portaloos, including accessible ones. I didn't make use of these though, so cannot comment further! I wasn't really aware of there being staff, all the stalls etc were manned by different groups and organisations. It is a busy festival event, so be prepared for that. The festival welcomes everybody, and shows the diversity of Glasgow, it's good to be a part of it."
Six by Nico,"Six by Nico Lovely restaurant & food. Visited this lovely restaurant with family. Disabled parking in the street just outside the restaurant. Pavements  were even & easily negotiated in my electric wheelchair. Level entrance to the restaurant . We were seated near the door which was ideal as it was busy & it might have been more difficult in the more crowded areas. There was an accessible toilet but I didn’t need to visit it. Staff were very friendly & helpful. My son had phoned before we went so they had a suitable table for us to sit at ready. Nice restaurant to go to with great food. See photo of menu. Six by Nico Delicious food, check out the pic of the menu. Bustling place - very efficient. Think it'd be worth phoning ahead to advise if you have any mobility issues. Taxi dropped off right outside We were seated right beside the door beside a free table so there was plenty of room to move around. Would have been fine apart from the plant and the vertical loo roll holder, which I knocked over while trying to turn round.  "
St Enoch Christmas Market at St Enoch Square,"St Enoch Christmas Market at St Enoch Square Small Market with good access. Very similar Market to George Street, though has no funfair rides and is smaller. In a horseshoe layout, this appeared to be as accessible and less congested than the Square.

There was an undercover area with a bar and seating Located within a pedestrianised area of the City, frequent and large choice of buses available, taxi  accessibility good and public parking in the area and with the St. Enoch multi storey car park.

Accessibility to stalls on one side of the markets due to there being a raised step and space restrictions within the stall, however staff are friendly and very helpful to facilitate people seeing   There are accessible toilets located within the St Enochs Shopping Center.

Campanile Hotel,"Campanile Hotel OK but could do better. We stayed at this hotel as it is very close to the Hydro arena. There were 6 disabled parking spaces of which 5 were occupied (4 with no blue badge on display).
Access into the hotel was easy with dropped kerbs and level access. Accessible toilet in the reception area.

We      Campanile Hotel Excellent hotel Campanile Glasgow. Everything was good, however the venue is very close to the SECC and the new multi storey car park. There were no events scheduled during our visit so I cannot say how easy it might be to access the hotel if the roads nearby were gridlocked. Several disabled spaces in front of hotel entrance Ground floor level access to breakfast and bar, through heavy door to lift, up one floor to bedrooms. Fire escape at end of corridor has ramped access to street. Loo on ground floor opposite entrance to bar , very good.
Accessible bathroom in room was huge. Had grab rails etc but as usual loo roll was perched on cistern.
Excellent shower.
Room had an upright chair useful if extra support needed getting in/out of bed. Very helpful Accurate information on hotel website about accessibility."
Hanoi Bike Shop,"Hanoi Bike Shop Lovely little place, very busy.This a lovely wee restaurant that serves Vietnamese street food, really tasty food and with a accessible loo! Walked here from Byres Road, about 2 minutes walk. 
Tarmac road, taxi's where going up and done it.
Subway was about a 7 minute walk away. Level access.
Restaurant was rather small and narrow inside, upstairs would not be accessible. Which is a pity as we enjoyed our dinner up on the balcony. 
The seating outside would be accessible though and perhaps with more room. It was great to see an accessible loo in such a restaurant.
Clean and not cluttered. Its was very busy but they took their time to explain the menu etc. Experienced here in one of the hottest days in Glasgow, which probably contributed to the good mood!
The food was really interesting and lovely though. Hanoi Bike Shop On yer Bike!. GHanoi Bike Shop has great food, great access and is in the trendy West End of Glasgow. There is an upstairs section that is does not have wheelchair access though. There is on street parking on Byres road which can provide an easy trip. However, it is a busy street and if there are no spaces available then parking is up a hill which would be tricky for manual wheelchair user to manage themselves. Electric wheelchair users and anyone with a mobility impairment  Almost perfect. The path leading to the front door (off Byres Rd) is a little bumpy. The front door has a tiny step (couple of inches) so is almost level access. Accessible toilet is just off the main restaurant area which is accessed between two tables. It was fine for me in my manual wheelchair but could be problematic for power wheelchair users. The door to the toilet does extend wider as you will see from the pictures. The staff could not have been more helpful throughout our visit. Booking an accessible was no problem at all. Really enjoyable visit and the staff will talk you through Vietnamese food if it is your first time trying it. I would certainly recommend the coconut tart for desert....Wow!!!"
Ollie's,"Ollie's Good food but issues with the toilet.a lovely café bistro in the heart of Pollockshields. A small menu but plenty of delicious treats. I got off the bus 30/40 yards away. Because there is no drop kerb on either side of the road you have to cross, you have to turn left travel 30 yards, cross the road and then 30 yards back again. This is obviously not the premises's fault but Glasgow City councils.
There is plenty of on street park It has step free access to the premises. It's quite tight with tables inside but the staff got me a suitable table. While I was sitting outside waiting for a friend I asked a member of staff if they had a accessible toilet. I was told they did so I felt quite comfortable having a couple of beers.
When it was time to use the WC, I discovered that their interpretation of an accessible toilet and mine where miles a The staff were very pleasant but when I asked about the toilet they could have warned me. The food was lovely. I wouldn't put other people off from going if you can manage a petite toilet. Ollie's Good food, access not great but staff lovely. Good food, access not great for ladies, but staff lovely Just parking on road outside but pretty busy area so space not guaranteed. On a level and spaces between tables not bad but busy on a Sat night. Ladies loo however up few stairs and through two tightly closing doors.

Also pop-up event next to museum where we listened to piping music from all over the world. There isn't any specific parking available for The National Piping Museum but, there is on street parking available behind the venue that is run by Glasgow City Council and blue badge holders can park for free here. Unfortunately there aren't many dropped kerbs near the on street parking though and  To get into The National Piping Museum you have to use a lift that is located at the side of the building. Unfortunately, there isn't a bell to alert staff if you are outside so I'm not sure if you would be able to visit spontaneously. You definitely need a staff member to assist you with the lift,  I can't comment on the accessible toilets as I didn't visit them but, there was a portacabin accessible toilet beside the pop up tent and an accessible toilet within The National Piping Museum.

Due to being pretty central in Glasgow I would also imagine that there is a Changing Place toilet not t Staff were very helpful when we visited and kindly reserved a table for us in the pop up tent to watch the bag piping music.

The only problem I would say is when we first wanted to go into The National Piping Museum, we had to wait for a while for them to get the right keys. After the first time   The National Piping Centre  Piping Idol. It was a bit of a bumpy ramp in and out of the tent. Went to go into Piping Centre for tour and had to wait as guy had no key to let us in (glad it was not raining)  Could not get to where food and drink was, had to get it brought to us..     I would like this venue to get the Welcome app as the staff seemed a bit flustered getting us into centre and with moving about. You always had to be escorted around.."
Greggs,"Greggs Poor experience- lacking accessibility. Myself and my friend Megan visited Greggs for a light bite and were not impressed by our experience. Firstly, its was very busy with the queue going out the door with no room to manoeuvre. When approaching the refrigerated foods, the reaching levels were not a      Greggs Big Sit-in Greggs. A big Sit-in Greggs attached to Buchanan Bus Station.

Easy access from Bus Station, but access from street (door at other side of shop) could be improved.

Large bright cafe area, and open long hours, great if commuting. Ha ha, is within Buchanan Bus Station, so can't really be nearer transport!

Is also right next door to  large multi-storey carpark (Concert Hall Carpark).

Glasgow Queen Street train station is a short walk away. Coming from the bus station, access is flat straight into Greggs. There is no door as such, as the entrance is an open space directly to the station.

However, if coming from the street (door at opposite side of shop), accessiblity could be improved.

Double doors which aren't automatic and don' None of the toilets seemed to be particularly attractive!

There is a door from the cafe area then a fairly narrow short corridor to the toilets. 

The accessible toilet is not very large to start with, and the position of the toilet and sink mean it could be quite difficult for some people (esp I did not have much need to interact with staff. They seemed extremely busy. Cafe is light and bright and pleasant to be in.

The fact this Greggs is open longer hours is handy

They could make a few adjustments to make it even more accessible"
Burger King,"Burger King Burger King wheelchair friendly?. We visited the outlet at 5pm in the evening. when we first entered, there was a crowd and it was difficult to manoeuvre around. the door is a push and pull door thus it will be hard for someone on a wheelchair to enter without the help of others. on the first floor, nearest parking is available at john lewis or buchanan galleries. the nearest bus station is the buchanan bus station the entrance requires manual pushing and pulling, there are stairs but no lift access to second floor where there are more seats, there are limited seats on the first floor, no other formats available it was on the second floor, need to climb the stairs to access, lack of physical aids. staff are welcoming and friendly, they were helpful and full of smiles  Burger King Small fast food with ok access and helpful staff. A small premise but good open space and helpful staff. Usual city centre parking. Renfield St if you are lucky or Concert Hall multi storey There is a double door that is not self opening but Glasgow folk are friendly and someone always notices and offers help. Door opens out into restaurant but no closure spring so easy to open. Wide door then sharp left turn to loo. Contrasting rails to sink and loo. Nappy bin well placed away from pan so right to left transfer space is clear. A pity a star is lost for the call help being a button three feet up the wall. Always offer to take your order to the table. "
Glasgow Cathedral,"Glasgow Cathedral Really nice place. There was a different door to enter due to wheelchair access, there was a small lift operated by staff both to get into the building and to get to the back of the church. This made it awkward as they tried to be super helpful and give you space but you needed to get someone’s atte Ample parking facilities on the streets nearby but all pay and display     Glasgow Cathedral Interesting visit. Access into cathedral was easy (at the opposite side to the main entrance), ask a member of staff to open the door then a member of staff operates the mobile lift however the lift inside the building which takes you to the upper part where services take place wasn't working so i c     "
Queen's Park,"Queen's Park Poor thought and negative experience. Very little thought has been put into this event, it was on street parking with no reserved parking for blue badge holders. The queuing system was problematic as wheelchairs were expected to get through a small gated area then narrow lanes to access the park. Th Only on street parking     Queen's Park Beautiful, Spacious and Mostly Accessible. We live near Queens Park and go there almost everyday with our young son who uses both a wheelchair and a walking frame. The park is very big for being in a city and has lots of different areas with different terrains. 

The play park is often busy and no There is no car park. There is lots of on-street parking. The easiest place to park is Langside Rd.

There are buses that stop near the park.

Queens Park train station is NOT accessible due to the large amount of steps to reach the platform. All entrances are wheelchair accessible. There are cobbles at the Victoria Rd and Pollokshaws Rd entrances.

There are benches along the main paths, around the ponds, in the rose garden and in the grounds of the glass house (currently closed)

Nando's,"Nando's Nando's- Sauchiehall Street. When on arrival, the second  entrance door was quite heavy in which someone manoeuvring in a wheel chair would find particularly difficult. This Nando's has 3 floors: upstairs, ground and downstairs, thankfully we was on the ground as there was tables available for us.Th close enough to the bus station and a train station but still at least a 10 minute walk from there. the actual restaurant had a downstairs ground floor and upstairs if there is no space on the ground floor of restaurant accessing the upper floor would arise some difficulty . The toilets are downstairs so is not accessible to  anyone manoeuvring in a wheelchair. Both male and female toilets are downstairs and I do not think there is a disabled toilet on the ground level which is not useful to anyone in a wheelchair. You go up to order your food so there is not much interaction with the staff throughout the visit to Nando's but when talking to them, they were friendly to us all.  Nando's Review of Nandos. Nandos in Glasgow city centre is a well liked Portuguese restaurant where the food is tasty and always an enjoyable experience. However the restaurant is small and tightly packed, meaning there is not a large amount of space and due to Nandos being a popular eating place it is alwa There is not a car park for the restaurant however there is one near although is not easily accessible to the restaurant and can be a 5/10 minute walk. There was not many noticeable signs for disabled access, however there were no stairs etc into the restaurant so easily accessible. Toilets are locate upstairs in the restaurant and so an individual must climb the large amounts of stairs. This is therefore not accessible for wheelchair users Staff are always very friendly and helpful. They are busy but always provide an excellent customer service to help every customer. "
Hilton Garden Inn,"Hilton Garden Inn Accessible pleasant restaurant with views of the river. Pleasant restaurant  - light and bright with interesting views over the river; accessible toilet at reception. Limited disabled parking and cobbles to contend with to get from car park to hotel door; staff advised ask to use the rear Riverside  Large car park adjacent to the hotel but only one disabled space allocated close to the flat paving stones which run around the hotel many other parking spaces but this means crossing uneven cobbles.

Fopp,"Fopp Fopp Byres Road reopens. Glad it's reopen but too cramped. Could not reach card machine and staff could.not give me it down so had to give staff my card.

Not specific parking On level N/A Emotionless and unhelpful Over the moon that Fopp is still open. But for the Love, look at your diversity training again.. Fopp Who can't resist a Fopp?. I saw Radiohead the night before and wanted to get The Bends on Vinyl as it was my favourite record as a kid - I surprise myself even today I know every word and riff off my heart. I was really glad that it was stock and purchased a copy!

Everyone likes an excuse to go t Great public transport and Hillhend subway is only a few doors down. Fopp as a chain sometimes tends to be cluttered with some stock on the floor but this shop wasn't too bad and the aisles where wider than normal.  Very happy, cheerful and helpful. Good vinyl and book selection."
Kelvingrove Bandstand,"Kelvingrove Bandstand The worst, most distracting viewpoint I've experienced as a wheelchair user.The disabled platform is not within the venue amphitheatre. I'm assured this is due to the listed nature of the building but i find it hard to accept that during its 2010s restoration full wheelchair access couldn't have bee There is no disabled parking close to the venue  There was, of course, a disabled toilet but as it was in the same building as the regular concerts i couldn't even enter it with a security person's assistance. She therefore led me to the Ladies ( I'm male ) which was - at that time quieter.   Kelvingrove Bandstand Great setting for the perfect outdoor Amphitheatre, Glaswegians dont bother too much with that rain!. I really like this bandstand and setting, we make a point of going every year to a gig, seen Echo and the Bunnymen, Super Furry Animals and this year it was my hometown local hero Neil Hannon with T Got the Subway to Kelvinbridge from Buchanan Street then took about a 7 minute walk to the bandstand via the park. 

Would be plenty of room for taxi's to drop you off. The access was good, with ramps to the accessible area. My only issue is that the accessible areas are always at the back, where I would not necessarily want to sit as you feel removed, but this is a common theme with accessible platforms. If you can manage the stairs, they are wide and have about a Provision of accessible loo's and their have been extra ones added since previous years down at stage level. True glaswegians, very friendly and helpful. The beer selection was absolutely horrible, the bouncer was laughing when we poured out our pints of Blue Moon as they were undrinkable and the only other option was Coors Light, so let's say we were happy that we weren't tempted with having too much!"
Holiday Inn,"Holiday Inn A very mixed bag. Everything seemed to be one extreme or the other: very accessible or utterly useless. First the usual struggle getting lined up to open the heavy door with a swipe card. No, accrual first was trying to operate the lift as you Jane to put your room key in to use it, and I kept findi Parking right opposite. Fairly expensive. Lowered ticket reader would be an important improvement, as would a lower pay machine with turning space to get close with wheelchair. In main review Rails just way out of position to the actual loo, and toilet so very low. Reception staff very helpful  Holiday Inn Close but no cigar. Bed was ok, the staff wonderful but the bathroom was a disgrace to be honest.  The shower was way to high for a wheelchair user to reach.  They had a stand alone stool to transfer to which was useless and unsafe for someone with one leg to transfer to.  A chair attached to the wa     "

Go Live! at the Green,"Go Live! at the Green Glasgow Live at Glasgow Green. The memory of the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games is still fondly remembered,  with its iconic 'G' structure in the centre of Glasgow Green.

Glasgow Green is a main venue for Within the city, Glasgow Green is fairly easy to get to. 
There is parking on the streets nearby, also several car parks within a 5-10 minute walk eg near St Enoch's shopping Centre.

The train stations are a bit further away, the closest being Glasgow Central or High Street. There are also buses This is a temporary, outdoor event, so there are some exhibits, marquees etc on grassy ground which -particularly depending on weather- could take more effort to reach if using a wheelchair.
However, the vast majority of it either follows the paved paths of the park, or had plastic matting walkways There are lots of portaloos, including accessible ones.

There was also a MobiLoo - which I had never seen before. It looks like a small van and on the side it says 'a vehicle for change.' Inside is a full accessible bathroom, complete with changing plinth and hoist. It has ramp access, and a memb All staff and volunteers (and there are MANY volunteers) were very friendly and welcoming.

Big Licks,Big Licks My Experience. I had a really nice time although I didn't use the toilet.     
McCune Smith Cafe,"McCune Smith Cafe Good coffee and great staff!!. Mccunes is an amazing independent cafe located on Duke Street, Glasgow. This has quickly became my favourite coffee shop as the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant whether on your own or with friends. There is on street parking right  outside the door and high street train station is just down the road. As this coffee shop is located in the city centre there are loads of other transport options within spitting distance. There are two doors to gain access to this coffee shop. I went along this time with a friend who uses a manual wheelchair and he was able to get in using the second door which has a small lip to get over. The door further down has a larger step which is not wheelchair accessible. 
When inside the c There are two bathrooms with one being wheelchair accessible. They are very easy to access and located just off one of the rooms. They are very clean and well kept. Staff are probably one of the best aspects of this place. They are the same people everytime I have been  in and I have started to have a bit of a rapport  with them! They even know that I bake bread and have been giving me tips! I try and visit this place whenever I have some free time at work as the atmosphere is relaxing and a change-up from the drag of work."
Project Ability,"Project Ability Amazing and brilliant!. I've been going to the ReConnect programme at Project Ability's studios for 12 years. In that time I've gone from walking without too much difficulty, to mostly using crutches, to being a wheelchair user. 

The building itself and the studios are very accessible. A choice o I drive to the studios and park in the disabled parking bays on Kings Street. There are additional disabled bays on several of the nearby streets and it's usually relatively easy to find a parking space. 

There are bus stops on the main road, within easy walking/wheeling distance, and Argyle Stre The entire building is very accessible. There's plenty of signs to tell you where to go, and friendly building staff who can assist. There are accessible toilets throughout the building, and a larger accessible changing places-style toilet within Project Ability's studio space. Staff are lovely "

Audio Lounge,"Audio Lounge For all your music making needs :). Accessible rehearsal space and recording studio with first class staff

Still just as brilliant years later. June 2022 update. Free parking right outside the door. Can be busy at times but I've never failed to find a spot. Level entry and double doors to access. Doors are heavy and not automatic but they are by reception desk and the staff are always on the lookout for musicians with equipment so are really fast to open the doors and welcome you in.
All studio spaces have wide enough doors to comply with access requi Toilets are easily accessible *I've only checked female toilet. The cubicle is large and there is room to side transfer to the right of the toilet for left side transferring from chair.
However there are no grab rails so if you require them you might struggle. Toilet is all painted white with a lig All staff are fabulously friendly and extremely efficient at being helpful :)  (especially Gary)
Great guys ensure you have great fun and return time and time again.

Arteries Gallery,"Arteries Gallery Wow! A great find ...From stopping to browse in the window, through to being invited in and made welcome it was a great experience. Some on street parking We found the gallery more by accident than judgement. As two powerchair users visiting the city to explore we ventured along some side streets. We found the gallery window and were admiring the painting when the ""gallery ladies"" (sorry we don't remember your names) invited us in. The door was level  No toilets The ""gallery ladies"" get tops marks as they went out of their way to make us welcome. Spent time showing us the various paintings and telling their stories. We really enjoyed the visit and will call by again. Particularly loved the seascape paintings ..."
University of Strathclyde,"University of Strathclyde A University which strives to give the best education possible to every student.I have been studying at The University of Strathclyde since August 2022 and I have never felt so well cared for. As a wheelchair user, getting around is always a problem and in a city like Glasgow with all it's hills, ev Parking is a problem in general in Glasgow, especially when roadworks are happening. That being said, I was given a parking permit which allows me to park in any university car park. Some buildings unfortunately are situated in areas where parking is a problem, the Royal College building is one of t Throughout the many buildings there are accessible routes set out. These assist anyone with a disability to move between buildings without the need to return to a vehicle and drive around the corner or wherever. I use these often to travel between the three main buildings my classes are in. If there There are accessible toilets in every building, some of these have now been designated gender neutral which means nothing different from what is was before. These are always large rooms with a single toilet. Some have showers in the room too. There are some toilets which do not have the standard flu All the staff are friendly and do their best to accommodate your needs. The system is not perfect but they do all they can. The staff have always said ""ask, if you have a need. If you do not tell us, we do not know and therefore cannot do anything to help."" From the very beginning I was welcomed and There are sanitizer stations around campus. If people wish to wear masks or don't wish to, that is their choice but if masks become mandatory again, they will be made mandatory."
CitizenM Hotel,"CitizenM Hotel Trendy and Accessible. Fantatic hotel which also has a free hot-desking facility. It's very central and close to shopping area at sauchiehall street. There is on street parking available, but it can be difficult to find a space at times. There is a bus stop directly across the road, which is handy. The road surfaces around the hotel can be quite uneven in places, so take care. The access into the hotel itself was Fantastic. Level access from the street and life access to all floors. It can be a little confusing at first because there is no obvious reception and quite often there are no staff at the main entrance. Physical access is ideal though. The loos are spacious enough, with the grab rails and space that I needed. There is an accessible loo on the ground and first floor areas which house the hot-desking and the cafe area. The staff are always incredibly welcoming and offer assistance wherever needed. Can't speak highly enough of the CitizenM staff. I would highly recommend this hotel to others. If using it for work meetings or just meeting a friend for coffee, it has a really relaxed feeling about it. The quirky layout and design of the hotel and it's decor, make for interesting conversations. Well worth a visit!"
Caffè Nero,"Caffè Nero Very friendly staff and good access. Level access, very friendly staff, tables can be moved. Large accessible loo at the back of the cafe. The store is pedestrianised section near the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. There is parking in the nearby Buchanan Galleries.  Also not far from Queen street train station (c5 mins walk). Not sure about local buses. Level access and easy to get about Good large loo at back of cafe.  A few things (highchairs etc) a bit in the way outside of it but pretty good apart from that. Very friendly Automated doors and tidier back of the shop near the loos would be great!"
Marks & Spencer,"Marks & Spencer appalling treatment. access is fine first class great adequate not allowed to put mothers wheelchair at table while food was collected from servery, told by young Mr Jobsworth to take wheelchair into queue, would not hear that two hands are needed to fetch food and two for pushing chair so had to leave without food and rather embarrassed a bit of discretion would have been great and avoid an embarrassing situation, it was not a matter of taking a table before collecting food, it was a necessity for safety of all concerned"
Di Maggio's,"Di Maggio's Friendly staff and good food. Lovely family-feel restaurant in friendly Glasgow. Food is always great here and the service impeccable. There is a step-free access but it's through a door that has to be opened from the inside, which is a small draw-back. Good seating on the level of the entry - i.e.  Parking is available across the street in the multi-storey car park. As I didn't travel by car I can't comment further. Step-free access but the staff have to open that door. That's not a problem as you are very visible when waiting so it's quick and helpful. Fine - all on the level and very close to the restaurant seating area. It's Glasgow and they are Italian. Friendly and helpful, of course! Very good choice for good food and low-key and stress-free surroundings"
Cineworld,"Cineworld Movies From A Different View. Cinema located in The Forge shopping centre which you enter up a ramped entrance with some disabled seating areas located at the back of the room. There are plenty of accessible parking at this Cineworld with it being located in a shopping centre and they are fairly close to the entrance.

I'm not from Glasgow so cannot comment on the public transport but, I did see bus stops nearby which looked like they came from all over Glasgow. It is double automatic doors to enter The Forge shopping centre and there are double doors to enter Cineworld but, these doors aren't automatic. They were open when I visited though so, maybe they are open all the time when the cinema was open.

There are 5 or 6 stairs that you need to go up to ge The accessible toilet is fairly spacious however, I feel there isn't much space to transfer at either side of the toilet. It is close to the wall at one side and there was a bin at the other side, although this can be moved. See image below.

As far as I know there isn't a Changing Place toilet ne When we arrived there wasn't anyone to scan my ticket, from then I didn't really interact with any more staff members. From looking around though the staff members seemed very friendly. "
Grosvenor Cinema,"Grosvenor Cinema The Grosvenor Cinema. Wheelchair accessible, Friendly staff, Great movies at affordable prices Cinema is located a short walk away from Hillhead (nearest SPT subway station) in the middle of a side alley, behind the Ubiquitous Chip (Restaurant). Walking from the exit of the subway station to the cinema is relatively easy as it requires little to no steps or lifts. However, as the roads are mainly cobbled, it might pose as a challenge to those who require wheelchair or walking aids. Do look out for the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant on the left  Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor of The Grosvenor Cinema on the right just after the ticket counter. Adequate cleanliness and basic aids were in place. Staff are cheerful, friendly and approachable. Cinema theatres are sloped with no stairs to seats, making it much more wheelchair friendly & less risk for tripping in the dark. Very much recommended to everyone!"
Eastwood Health and Care Centre,"Eastwood Health and Care Centre Lite Brite pleasant cafe in a health centre. You may only be visiting because your Healthcare professional is very here but it's a fully accessible cafe staffed by willings and pleasant staff with very reasonably priced food Large number of disabled parking spaces by the automatic doors although the rest of the car park can be very busy. Several bus stops nearby and train station also but this is fairly inaccessible. Automatic doors into well lit large flat area with small cafe with widely spaced tables and a self-service counter although staff will bring food and drink to the tables for you. Although not actually at the cafe only a short distance passed reception desk is a fully accessible and large uncluttered disabled toilet Excellent Pleasant cheerful staff. Certain mornings each week are dedicated to cuppa and chat in the cafe - anyone welcome to turn up and join in Basic, but enjoyable and extremely reasonably priced food and drink"
Tony Macaroni,"Tony Macaroni Great restaurant - helpful staff. Great food and very enjoyable, you can access well the place in a wheelchair, they will ask if you want to transfer to a booth seat (which is most of the seating ) and they will take your chair away, alternatively there is a small seating area, with 2 x tables for 4 disabld parking directly opposite, 20 m fro door    "
Royal Conservatoire of Scotland,"Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Performances for all!. Not being sure of quite what to expect it was great to discover the range of performances and opportunities on offer for disabled people. Parking can be arranged on site for people with limited mobility; simply get in touch to discuss your requirements. Public transport operates nearby and it's easy to get into the building from street level. Good finding a clearly marked step free route to get in the building. Once inside there was a dropped counter with staff on hand to help. There were plenty of signs to help you navigate once you knew the name of the area you were heading for. A gloriously spacious lift takes you up to the main floor I visited a couple of the accessible toilets and these were modern and fairly spacious. The staff I meet were knowledgeable, helpful and very keen to make the experience of visiting a good one. Some creative thinking was evident about opening up the performances to as wider audience as possible. There were infa red sound systems, induction loops, sighted guide training and more. One of those places where once visited you know you have to go again!"
Banco Bar & Kitchen,"Banco Bar & Kitchen Tasty Italian. Tasty Italian food in a comfortable setting There is some on street parking. I got here by bus, The number 38 and the number 4 to Ayr are every 30 minutes, The bus stops are close by. This is a very old building, it was a bank years ago. They have ramped access.

H&M,"H&M Very Accessible. H & M store on Sauchiehall Street has restricted access, HOWEVER, there is an accessible door at the entrance at Buchanan Gallerias beside the shop which you can use and there is an accessible entrance into the shop from there. The majority of the shop is accessible, however there a Very accessible from the bus station or train station as it is all pedestrianized. However there are quite a few steep hills that you require to go up / down. There isn't any seats for anyone to take a rest whilst walking around the shop and no signs indicating that they had a hearing aid assistance loop installed.   "
India Quay,"India Quay Great Indian restaurant in Glasgow. Had a great evening at India quay. Staff reserved a table for us on the ground floor. Easy level entrance from the street overlooking the squinty bridge. Wide door entrance at the front next to the revolving door perfect for powered chair.

Very Attentive understood our needs as a family . Would come again, great restaurant, lovely food."
Arran Aromatics,"Arran Aromatics Aromatic and great for gifts. The store was easy to get in with a large open frontage onto St. Enoch Centre. Plenty of space to get in and a well laid out store with enough room for more than one wheelchair to easily browse around.  The store was level access from the St. Enoch Centre with an open plan frontage. Once in the store there was plenty of space for us as powerchair users to easily browse around without fear of demolishing the displays (not unheard of in our case)!

Everything was easy to see and well arranged. There is an accessible toilet in the St. Enoch Centre and it's only a few metres from the entrance to the Arran Aromatics store. Friendly and helpful. "
David Livingstone Birthplace,"David Livingstone Birthplace Top Quality Updated Visitor Attraction. First visit to recently upgraded David Livingstone Centre. Amazed at the improvement on the old centre and the layout of the various exhibits.  A good modern museum. Easy access and good disabled parking. No issues when driving. Nearest station is Blantyre and straightforward route to centre.  A bit of a walk but on quiet residential street. All paths are well surfaced and good for wheelchair users and anyone with mobility issues. Main entrance is on level.  Centre is on three levels with lift and staff to assist if needed.  Displays are well set out and easy to read.  There are seats around centre if you need a rest.
Cafe and shop are Easy to find both in museum and separate cafe.   Didn't use, but other toilets are clean and modern so expect disabled ones to be of same standard Warmly welcomed by all staff and given assistance when required.  It is necessary to go outside the centre to visit the AV presentation and a member of staff accompanied  us. "
The Fish People Café,"The Fish People Café small, but perfectly formed. small restaurant but level access, good food, large disabled toilet, helpful staffand excellent food. But you've got to like fish! next door to underground station and close to bus stops; next to multi-storey car park and small on road parking area large pavement to door of restaurant but level accesss exceptt for small bump at the threshold of main door.

The Library at the Bridge,"The Library at the Bridge Nice and Freindly venue. I like this place for meetings and also for meeting freinds its quite when the schools are in the only time it gets busy is between 12 and 1pm and when the schools are off 

THis venue is very bright and modern This venue has a massive car park, the public transport is very good here at the venue This venue is totally wheelchair freindly, their is no were un-accessible for people with a disability Their is a disabled toilet within the bottem of the libary and their is one within the cafe at the top, I have never had any issues with the staff they are really nice I would recommend this place and its very autism freindly"
The Titan,"The Titan Reasonably accessible hotel, function room, and pub. Attended a function , only visited the function suite. 
Small lift specifically for disabled access a bit tight, a bigger power chair would struggle, difficult to manage lift independently .
Plenty of parking on site, and ramps for wheelchair ac Travelled by car, plenty of parking, and designated accessible spaces near the entrances. 
On a public bus route, and less than a mile from Clydebank Railway Station Good access, ramps throughout the building. Signage could be better .
As mentioned accessible lift to access function room, narrow and difficult to access , would no have managed on my own Accessible toilets in the building, but not visited on this occasion Friendly and helpful, could not have done more to help "
Vue Cinemas,"Vue Cinemas New Vue Cinema. Newly opened Vue Cinema within the St Enoch Shopping Centre in Glasgow St Enochs car park is behind the Centre itself. If going to the cinema (+ don't have a blue badge) Get your parking ticket validated at the cinema, and the parking is only £1 for 4hrs - long enough for any film! 

The nearest train stations are Glasgow Central and Queen Street. Buses and undergrou The cinema is on the first floor of the St Enoch Centre, so you first of all have to reach the first floor - there is a lift and escalators. 

From the first floor, there is then an escalator leading to the entrance of the cinema, there is also a lift to the entrance. 
It seems a pity this lift c There were several accessible toilets, these were next to the other toilets, and had the same decor. 

The toilet was large enough to manoeuvre a wheelchair/ have carers. 
The toilet had a full length mirror on the door - something which is often missed in accessible toilets. I didn't have much interaction with staff, I had bought my tickets online, and didn't buy any snacks. 
There were staff around though and seemed engaged with people/ready to help. There were hand gels throughout and you were asked to wear masks - though you can take them off to eat snacks, so people had them off quite a lot of the time. 
As it has reclining seats, there is naturally more room between people than there would be in a standard cinema."
The Three Craws,"The Three Craws Spacious pub/restaurant with parking and good access. We had lunch in this neighbourhood pub. It has reasonable parking and a good accessible toilet. The car park is tarmac. It is not that big and has only two Blue Badge spaces, but I've always been able to get parked. I think many of the locals walk to the pub. Since Covid some of the car park has been given over to outside seating. If you are able to drop someone off there is free on street par There is a gentle ramped area to enter - see last photo. It's a little uneven at the lowered kerb - no problem for a wheelchair but just a bit trickier for a rollator. There was room to get the wheelchair past the A boards without moving them.

There are two sets of doors but they are not too heav The toilet needs a RADAR key, even though it is right next to the standard toilets. The door is light and stays open by itself. There is plenty of room for a wheelchair user and assistant. Grips on both sides are very helpful.

Three things stop it getting five stars. The lighting is a bit dim and They are always very friendly and  cheerful. We were impressed by a very prompt response when my relative pulled the red cord. Inspite of it being tangled around the grip she still managed to catch it by mistake! I've been here often with friends who live locally, but not with a wheelchair user until now. It's always a good place for a catch up. If there is music it's played at a very low level to allow conversation. It can get busy in the evenings.

The pub is not too far (driving, unless you are able bod"
Bowlarama,"Bowlarama Accessible Venue. We attended as it was one of the accessible places we could go for bowling and fun. The lift was easily accessible; however hard to find on arrival, and you had to walk through someone playing their game. 

We had a non-accessible bowling area, but because of bookings, everyone c     "
Glasgow Club Scotstoun,"Glasgow Club Scotstoun Wheelchair Tennis at Scotstoun. Accessible leisure centre that offers Tennis, Badminton, Squash, Swimming and many more sports. It has an accessible cafe and lots of accessible parking spaces too. There is a healthy number of accessible parking bays on both sides of the centre, but signage when entering the car park could be better. The main entrance has a revolving door, which can be difficult for most people, but especially for disabled visitors. There is an assisted accessible door to the left of the main door, but as there is a slight incline, it can difficult if someone is taking in a sports chair with them etc. Once in th There are loos immediately as you enter the building and then again next to the changing area. They are cleaned regularly and had everything I needed to use them safely. The staff re incredibly helpful from the minute we went through the front door. The assisted us when needed and made us feel welcome and valued I have been going to Scotstoun LC for a number of years. The improvements to the reception area have meant it is now much more spacious and easier to manoeuvre in my manual and sports chairs. Well worth a visit to some of the accessible sports clubs that take place in Scotstoun LC."
Nuffield Health Fitness & Wellbeing,"Nuffield Health Fitness & Wellbeing Nuffield health milngavie fitness centre. Overall Nuffield health Milngavie is very accommodating to people with disabilities through implementing a wheelchair lift and disabled parking. This creates a positive atmosphere for visitors who require this service. There are multiple disabled parking spaces within a few steps of the building. There are lifts and several bathrooms specifically designed for people with physical disabilities, making it a comfortable environment. There are multiple disabled toilets in the facility, which are clearly marked to inform others easily. The staff was very welcoming and happy to assist anyone in need.

Suitable for wheelchair although meter parking close by it is occupied.  we parked St Enoch's which is close by and accessible    approx 300 yards away door a bit stiff on your own but with someone more able would be much easier.

Hotel Chocolat Café,"Hotel Chocolat Café A chocolate fix. This is the UK's foremost ethical chocolatier. They have been in Glasgow and Edinburgh for a few years selling chocolate but have now opened a much welcomed coffee shop in Buchanan Street, Glasgow. Good access to Hot chocolate like you have never tasted before. Close to St Enoch Car Park and public transport Level access from Buchanan Street. Wide double doors. Lots of circulation space in the shop. Cafe area at back with easy to move furniture and adequate circulation space. Bench seating is firm and for me was easy to transfer to. The red cord was too short, the lugs on the toilet seat had not been properly adjusted and there was a nappy bin in the transfer space HOWEVER, the store has only been open for a week and the manager was very welcoming of and attentive to my feedback. SO I am giving the 4 stars for a good start with Supervisor and Manager were very positive and welcoming of my first stage review. I told them to keep an eye on Euan's guide. "
PureGym Glasgow Hope Street,"PureGym Glasgow Hope Street Very good gym with good staff!. I visit the Glasgow Hope Street PureGym on a regular basis. I always find the gym easy to access and navigate, and the staff are always very helpful. I have PT sessions with Jordan who specialises in mobility and rehab, he's very knowledgable and has a few disabled cl I don't know what the parking is like, but it's city centre so I'm guessing there's good parking nearby. However, public transport wise - it's directly next to central station and there's a bus stop right outside the door! The accessible door works well, although you have to contact PureGym HQ to allow your PIN to have access to it. When I joined up, the gym manager arranged for a free fob for me (usually they charge customers for these) to allow me to 'tap' my way in, instead of typing in my PIN. This is great and ma The accessible toilet and shower are great, my only negative would be there there is regularly gym equipment placed in front of it. I've spoken with the gym manager about this and, hopefully, this will no longer happen. Fingers crossed! Always helpful when I need assistance. I've had a couple of PTs in here for various things and they've all been great. Whilst the access to the gym, the changing rooms, and the toilets are easy - I would remind people, this is a high street gym. Therefore, there is no specialist equipment for disabled users that I've seen and gym users would have to be able to transfer onto the machine. I'm visually impaired so tran"
Henleys,"Henleys Sweeties galore!. What a fab store! Jars, pots and packets of brightly coloured sweeties. Plenty of space to roll in and explore without having to peer over counters.  The sweet shop has a wide entrance from the St. Enoch Centre. There's plenty of space once you're inside - we found it easy as two powerchair users to browse and see everything that was on display. So tempting to buy tons of goodies to take home!! There is an accessible toilet in the St. Enoch Centre. Staff happy to help An old style sweet shop with lines and lines of jars. A place to get all the old favourites from your childhood."

Glasgow Botanic Gardens,"Glasgow Botanic Gardens Great place, with spectacular bedding. The gardens are council run and therefore perhaps not as grand as the Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden, however, we noticed that the beds in the amazing glasshouses where more 'showy' and really impressive.

Most paths around the gardens where flat or on a gent We got the bus and it stopped opposite the side gate on Great Western Road.

Don't remember parking access. Most paths where flat, wide and on a gentle slope.  The paths around the victorian Glasshouses where wide and full of interesting information signage and great displays. The area down to the lake is not accessible. As steps get narrow and narrower down the bottom, I had my personal handrail and the  Clean and plenty of room. The staff and the restaurant were really happy, patient and listened to me, even on a really busy day. Very worth a visit, and enjoy the magnificent carnivorous plants display and oh the Begonia's too (in the 80's styled glasshouses).....And the tea and carrot cake was lovely in the cafe!"

Nic's NYC Deli,"Nic's NYC Deli Cheap cheerful, tasty and with an accessible loo. We were going to a gig at Òran Mór on Friday night and we wanted to do it on the cheap because we had been rather social recently. We had a banana and a chocolate bar on the bus but fancied a snack, which was better than grabbing a pint. We got the bus to Glasgow then one to hillhead. Good if you have a concession bus pass. The hillhead sub way is pretty much next to it also. There was no step and the aisles where wide enough beside the counter and the tables. See picture. Cheerful, commiciated well with me and explained some of the deals. I had a chicken tikka crepe which was surprisingly tasty. Coffee was good too as it perked me up as I was flagging a bit too. I had my first ever 'twinkies' after always wanting to try one out, found out they were a bit sickly, ha!"
Dimora,"Dimora friendly and accessible Italian restaurant serving good food. A little awkward to get in and out of as separate entrance from the main door, but over all fully accessible ground floor level Small car park with one disabled space. If you're lucky enough to get that place, then access good. Otherwise a bit of a struggle as limited street parking. Bus stop nearby. Separate door to one side can be opened to allow access for wheelchair; moderate slope to the doorbut not too difficult to move around Providing you are on ground floor all is level, chairs widely spaced in the front part of the restaurant but more crowded in the rear conservatory Big wide uncluttered toilet with appropriate grab rails; bit of an awkward door arrangement to get in and out without banging main restaurant Excellent value afternoon tea served by friendly staff"

Taco Bell,"Taco Bell Need help entering but accessible otherwise. The restaurant has an accessible toilet and has seating at floor level. Make sure you have someone with you, as it is a slim double door. It is rather a small venue but Tim Hortons is across the road for doughnuts and coffee.     "
Tesco Metro,"Tesco Metro Tesco Metro Sauchiehall Street. This shop is located along Sauchiehall St; it is easily accessed via automatic doors (flat surfaced entrance).

Radisson Red,"Radisson Red Best accessibility yet!. Spacious room, automatic door, super wet room and pet friendly! A couple of little things which would make it 5 stars are, a longer hairdryer cord as some would struggle to use it so short and if they'd remove the rug under the bed as this slightly affected our ability to tr There's a car park at the back of the hotel. Ramp access and automatic doors. Reception to your left as you go in, not behind a desk so accessible for all. Lifts to all floors but bar / restaurant level access on ground floor.

Projectionist,"Projectionist Tasty, reasonably priced meal in an accessible pub/restaurant. The Projectionist is attached to  Soar at Braehead, a centre with various physical activities and a cinema. As a fairly new building, it has good access. Given the location is an activity centre, there is a great deal of parking and many blue badge spaces. One thing we have noticed about very modern places, however, is that there is a great deal of pedestrian/pavement space between the parking and the buildings - and even between the drop-off space a Access is completely level. There are two sets of doors to enter from the car park, both quite heavy. The outer set helpfully stays open when pulled right back. There is another door directly from the interior of Soar.

Most of the interior is carpeted and it is spacious. Meals are ordered and pai The toilet has grab rails on both sides and the red cord goes to the floor, although we pulled it out from where it was tucked behind a bin. The area is spacious enough for a wheelchair and carer but was a bit dark in one half. The lighting above the toilet was fine though.

A notice on the door s All very pleasant. Although Hungry Horses have the same menu, some chefs seem to cook it better than others. This was one of the better ones. The music here was a bit loud for a lunchtime - enough to trouble my relative who has hearing aids.

There is a large Wetherspoons next door (The Lord of the Isles) which also"
Hillhead Bookclub,"Hillhead Bookclub Great place to meet, enjoy a drink and pretty accessible.This is the place to be in Glasgows West End.
Nice selection of beers and cocktails, interesting and fun layout and pretty accessible. Got here from the subway - 4 minute walk.
Same distance from Botanics. This place has thought of access well, some areas are inaccessible but the main part of the interior bar and all of the outside is accessible. Plenty space around tables and aisles. Good sized toilet at the front of the entrance.
Well fitted out. Cheerful and friendly. Great place for a nice refreshing drink on a hot summers day!"
Mono Cafe Bar,"Mono Cafe Bar Great lunch and drinks in quirky cafe bar. This is a quirky cafe bar in the Glasgow city centre area. It has very good (but basic) facilities, but the focus is clearly more on the warm welcome and atmosphere of the place than the bricks and mortar. We drove to the area because we were going to look in a few different shops around Mono. We managed to get on street parking behind the strip of shops, but it was quite busy. There are good transport links though, as it is in the city centre. Access into the cafe bar is through a single wooden door that has glass panels. Once inside, it is very spacious, although I'm sure it'll get busier when they have live music etc. The tables are split over two floors, but there were plenty of available tables for us on the lower section to choose fr There was an accessible loo, but the door was covered in band posters, which could be difficult for some visitors to notice without support. The loo itself was basic, but had what I needed as a manual chair user. The staff were very helpful and chatted with my daughter, which was nice. We only intended going in for a hot chocolate while we waited for the store next door to open, but ended up having lunch too as we felt so welcome. The cafe bar also has a music section where you can buy CD's and vinyl record. The ceiling of Mono is very pretty too, and they make their own lemonade in large steel canisters that line the place. Very cool to see!"
The Hengler's Circus,"The Hengler's Circus Good space, good lunch, could be improved. Good circulation space, tasty food, reasonably priced. Usual city parking. You just need to get lucky on the streets. Being on my mobility scooter that lives in the car I was able to scoot quite a long way. Marked it down as doors are heavy on on a spring. Excellent door width with just one door open. There is usually someone lurking nearby who will open the door. Once inside circulation space is good for even the largest chair. Clean accessible toilet with Radar key entry or key at the bar. It had all the necessary rails and the red cord was fine but problems created by combining it with baby change. Nappy bin by the toilet would make side transfer difficult. Would be a bit of a squeeze to also fit a carer. Unless they are Friendly and helpful. "
Finn's Place,"Finn's Place A good community space. A large community space attached to Langside parish church. They have a number of different activities on most days.
I went to see a play as part of the South side fringe. Once in a generation was a play about a husband and wife on different sides of the independence debate. There is on street parking but because it's a residential area with lots of tenements it's fairly busy.
Battlefield road which is well served by a number of different buses is a couple of hundred yards away.
There is an entrance to Mount Florida train station on battlefield road but this is inacce It is ramped up to the entrance. There is automatic doors. A very large clean toilet. The staff were very helpful. "
House of Fraser,"House of Fraser Still a few gems in the crown. Probably the last store of its kind in Scotland even though it’s not independent. All the Fraser stores carry pretty much the same stock, but this is the flagship store in Scotland, the customer service still has a bygone era feel to it especially among the older, expe Frases are located mostly on Buchanan Street which is pedestrianised, though buses and the locality of both Glasgow Central, Queen Street stations and the underground is within 3 mins. Mitchell Street multi story car park is close by with area parking on St. Vincent Street, be aware Glasgow isa grid Double power assisted doors on all street level. Did not visit. Fantastic, friendly and helpful. They warmly welcome everyone particularly if you are regular. Rhona is always offered a seat when she is met given her use of a walking aid or myself with my symbol cane. It’s a perfect place to want to visit or to particularly purchase something. Where relevant I am offered the opportunity and invited to touch the texture of various products especially where there is a subtle finish in the workmanship of where new fragrances are available and can be tested.

Crossbasket Castle,"Crossbasket Castle Delicious. We went to Cross Basket Castle for afternoon tea. There was a parking area just beside the venue. We did accidentally drive past it as the sign was not clear. The main entrance has steps but they do have  portable ramps to allow access for wheelchair users. The ramps where very steep. Luc We drove to the castle. The sign was not all that clear. There was plenty of parking at the castle and we were able to drop me off right outside the main entrance. There are steps at the main entrance to the castle but they do have portable ramps for wheelchair access. The ramps were steep but luckily a male member of staff helped push me up.

The Coffee Club Restaurant,"The Coffee Club Restaurant Great coffee - scary neighbours!!. Located at World of Golf, next to the Jurassic Parr Centre (hence review title) access is gained via the main entrance shared with the golf shop. Everything is on the one level and generally there is plenty of room between tables. Suggest calling ahead and booking  Plenty of parking outside with a good number of disabled parking bays.  There is a bus stop located nearby but couldn't say how frequent the service was. Ramped access which might be a bit tight for those using electric wheelchairs. Manual doors at entrance but usually plenty of staff/fellow customers on hand ready to assist. Access to coffee shop slightly hampered by child's ridealong but not too bad. Again, manual doors into the coffee shop. One disabled toilet next to the doors through to the coffee shop. Looked clean and, most importantly, free of clutter! Couldn't fault them. Lovely warm welcome from very attentive staff. Even when there's a queue the team works together to make sure everyone is dealt with quickly and efficiently.  There was a table of  8-10 ladies having lunch and within about 3 mins of them leaving the table was cleared and re-set  Lovely coffee. Enjoyed the Cajun chicken burger and the cod goujons. Wanted to try the carrot cake but didn't have room!  Bill plus 2 coffees was £20. Full details, including their menu at: http://www.coffeeclubscotland.co.uk/index.php"

Halloumi South,"Halloumi South Authentic Greek food. Really authentic Greek food. A good range of different dishes on the menu. The food is served tapas style, that's sharing plates, which is not to everybody's liking but is a very social way of eating. There are some lovely grilled dishes which are an absolute treat. This part of Pollockshaws road is quite busy. If you're driving there are some sidestreets but on street parking is quite difficult. It is well served by bus from the city center and many places on the South side. Queen's Park train station is close by but is not accessible for wheelchairs also beca There is a small lip at the entrance, probably only about 10 mm. It's very easy to move around inside also the tables were at a good height. The accessible toilet was very large and nice and clean. The staff are very attentive. They explained what some of the dishes are and how they're cooked. I really enjoyed the food here, I will definitely be back."
Hug Café,"Hug Café A hidden gem. A very welcoming well run Café/bistro. If your looking for breakfast or lunch this place is definitely well worth a visit. There's lots of choice and different specials on every day. This place is 40/50 yards down Skirving Street from Kilmarnock Rd in Shawlands. Getting here on public transport is fairly easy as there's bus stops close by. On street parking is very limited Access is very good, there are no steps in the doorway is wide enough for a large chair or scooter. The slight drawback is the tables and chairs outside that impede access slightly but they are easily moved.
With large windows and good lighting it would be good for people with visual impairments. I Lots of room and very clean. Very attentive and helpful A very pleasant experience. I will be back."
Bella Italia,"Bella Italia Great Italian restaurant in the city centre. One of my favourite Italian restaurants in the city centre for convenience, great food, decor and staff. There isn't parking outside the restaurant as it's located on the high street surrounded by shops and restaurants. We often park as close as possible in the surrounding streets or in the multi-storey carpark on Port Dundas Road, which is across from Cineworld and roughly less than 5 minutes walk fro Access is through double glass doors, but the door is automatic by pushing the wheelchair button. There are no steps at all - level access throughout. 

The entrance where you wait to be seated is slightly on the small size, but manageable in my powerchair. 

The tables have been fine for my whe There is one accessible toilet upstairs and the standard toilets are downstairs - this is the reason for the low star rating. I've been to this restaurant many times now and consider it a family favourite of mine, but I feel the accessible toilet should have a RADAR key as it appears to be abused by The staff, especially Madga (waitress) are great - very friendly and makes us feel very welcome. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice restaurant and great Italian food in the city centre. There are so many options on the menu as well as a gluten-free and vegan menu which is what we go for. Never disappointed with the food."
Caffè Nero,"Caffè Nero Handy cafe near to Central Station. Nice cafe if you are going for the train and fancy a quick cuppa near to the station. Service was fine, there is a disabled toilet at the back of the cafe. It is not that well signposted to be honest and a bit of a squeeze depending on how busy it is. The counter   Easy access from the front door, although you may need assistance at the door. The toilets were an average size, but seemed to be used by everyone but to be fair the toilets signage is not very clear and the other toilets are located downstairs so i would imagine that is why so many people nipped in here instead. the staff were friendly enough and i think if you said to them you needed assistance to get to the toilet they would help you.

Vodafone,"Vodafone Phone shopping. Looking for a mobile shop Vodafone was easy to get in and plenty of space to wheel around. Pedestrianised area The door from the pedestrianised area was wide and easy enough to roll in. Once inside the floor was laminate and there was plenty of space. It was bright, light and easy to see everything. No toilets I was greeted by a customer services guy when I entered and he offered to help. The environment was welcoming and I was impressed by the  instant offer of assistance."
Wild Cabaret,Wild Cabaret accessibly place thats fun!. Wild Cabaret is found in the beautiful setting of Glasgow Merchant City/Candelriggs. It is down a quiet side street where there are a few restaurants which don't need additonal ramp access because there are no steps on entering. the room where food is served and performa this is almost N/A as there is no parking for the surrounding area bar an NCP multi storey car park around the corner however with good pavements etc this wouldn't be an issue to get from. the street however is quiet enough for drop off with wide smooth pavements making wheelchair use easier. smooth with no steps or need for additonal ramps however large glass doors which would need support opening. the dining area is spacious and laid out long rows of tables. there are booths but these are not wheelchair friendly. waiting staff seemed very supportive to wheelchair users and encouraged j the toilet itself is in a large room. Appropriate bars in place and plenty of space to maneouver. it does double as a baby changing area. it isnt where the other bathrooms are but near the front entrance discretly placed and definately accessible but does seem a little out the way. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and reassuring. I wanted to review this place as it isnt your typical restaurant theres entertainment and good night out and something different and i am just so glad it is accessible to people in wheelchairs so not to miss out. additonal note large heavy curtains cover the doors from main entrance into dining area
The Arches,"The Arches Good access but a bit hard to see where you're going.We were there at a conference and only saw the main floor but access seemed v straightforward throughout the venue. Automatic door to get in, level access in and around the venue with lots of space to move about. Just a point lost for the accessib We came direct from Queen Street station which was pretty easy. Just 10 min stroll down Buchanan st. Queen St assistance as ever were excellent.  The venue is also just beside central station. 
Look to be quite a few buses nearby. Not much parking I don't think.  Big accessible loo but door was VERY heavy and hard to do on your own. 

Has a radar key but staff in cloakroom (which is beside the loo) have one too and were b friendly and helpful. 

Loo was very smelly though so pretty unpleasant. Excellent The venue is very dark with lots of overhead spotlights so could be challenging for some people."
WILLIAM Cafe,WILLIAM Cafe Cosy nook in the west end of Glasgow. As described in the title this is a small cosy cafe on Queen Margaret Drive in Glasgows West end. They serve delicious coffee with good options for both breakfast and lunch! Staff are very attentive and provide good chat! On street parking is available outside and there are many side streets also with free parking! Many options for seating with some high stools at the front and comfy benches down one side. It can get quite cramped so wheelchair access could become tricky! Only had a small coffee so the toilets were not trialed on this occasion! I'll be sure to have a couple next time so that they can get a good use! Staff are very nice and some are even quite eccentric which adds some humor to this place! If you would like a cosy nook just off the beaten track from the core of the west end then this is definitely a place to have a quiet coffee and sandwich!
Mental Munchies,"Mental Munchies Easy to access, but you probably shouldn't! ;). This is a wide, bright and spacious dessert shop with smooth hard floor and way, way too many delicious sugary delights.
The male member of staff (the one who does the tiktoks) is very very kind and helpful. Very thoughtful too.

VisitScotland Office,"VisitScotland Office Easy to access. Unexpectedly, for an office access was particularly good in this instance. It was particularly good for access to public transport as they were bus stops immediately outside and it's only a short walk to the train station is both Queen Street and Central. Plenty of taxis were in evidence as they passed by the door frequently. Getting into the building was via a level access large glass door. On entry the reception staff pointed out the lift and helped to hold the door whilst I wheeled in. The office I was visiting had wide doors, level access and plenty of space to manoeuvre around. There was an easy to access accessible toilet. It was clean and tidy and had sufficient space for me to manoeuvre. It might be a little tight for some larger power chair users. Throughout my visit staff were exceedingly helpful. From the reception person to help with a lift, through to the office staff who gave a mini tour and orientation which was excellent! "

As we walked to the restaurant, we avoided the difficulty of finding parking and proved easier for us. Upon entrance, there is a wheelchair lift to take you from the front door to the main body of the restaurant, in order to avoid the steps. This was well sign posted, and was available for non wheelchair users to use too. 
Although there are a lot of booths, there are also a large number of more acc There is a fully accessible bathroom located on the main floor of the restaurant. This was a spacious, clean and well sign posted. The helpful staff are available to provide directions to the bathroom if you miss the sign postings. Staff were friendly, approachable, helpful and courteous. They made our experience at Stack & Still enjoyable and memorable. With great service and help throughout our visit, we had no problem paying the additional service charge on the bill. We would highly recommend Stack & Still to all ages of people as a great place for food at any time of the day.
However, as it has newly opened it is still quite busy, so avoid peak times if you don't want to wait. Early morning or later evenings should be quieter."
Christopher Robin,"Christopher Robin Great food and great service!. This cafe has level access from the street, plenty of on street parking available in the area and very welcoming staff! Most importantly though the food, coffee and cake are amazing! There is plenty of free on-street parking on all sides of the block where the cafe is situated, but it can be bust during the day with deliveries and resident parking. There is level access through the front door, but this can be a little tricky as it is a pull-door which could cause issues for some wheelchair users or people with buggies, when entering. When inside, it is a 'cosy' sized cafe, but all of the furniture is removable, so seating arrangements can be a There is an accessible loo at the rear of the cafe which is easily visible. There is a slight incline to the door of the loo, but I managed it fine in my manual wheelchair. I have been to this cafe a few times now, and every time I have been welcomed with a smile and a chat. The staff have done everything possible to make the visit as pleasant as possible. You can tell that they feel an immense sense of pride in their work and in making 'everyone' feel welcome. On the menu it mentions that the cafe is owned by two friends, Christopher and Robin. All of the dishes are created using locally and ethically sourced ingredients."
Kilmurry & Co,"Kilmurry & Co Tasty treats. Kilmurrys is the old Newlands post office. They have made great use of a limited space. The tables inside are quite close together but a member of staff got me a suitable table.
There is seating outside for alfresco dining when weather permits [you have to remember we are in Glasgow]. there is limited on street parking. Pollockshaws Road is a good bus route with plenty of stops nearby. Pollockshaws East railway station is close by but it is not accessible for wheelchairs. access to the premises is good. There is not much room to move around inside but they will usually get you seated. great to have an accessible toilet in such a small place. It is tight getting into the toilet but ok once inside.
I had to pull the alarm cord as I was unable to turn the thumb lock, I dislike these fiddly locks. The staff I encountered were very helpful. It's small sharing plates, tapas style. I tried a few dishes they were all very tasty."

The Society Room,"The Society Room Our visit to the Society Room. Overall very good! The venue is in the middle of town so there are many transport options. Bus, train, car, taxi or subway! However there are little to no parking spaces outside the venue. If you are lucky enough to find a space close by you may have to cross the many busy roads. The closest train stations are Glasgow At the front of the venue there is a set of stairs and a ramp wide enough to access by wheelchair leading to a spacious entrance.

The Dapper Mongoose,"The Dapper Mongoose Funky name, funky food. The dapper mongoose is on the site of the old Bell and Felix. I enjoyed the old place but this is a step up in class, the food and drink was top-quality. They have rearranged the interior which makes it easier to navigate in a wheelchair. There is some, although limited on street car parking. Pollockshaws East railway station is a couple of hundred yards away, this station is inaccessible for wheelchairs. Bus stops in both directions are close by. The entrances is step free. There is the front door and then a door inside which would cause problems for wheelchairs if you are on your own but the staff can easily spot your outside. With it being quite a small restaurant these doors are needed to keep the wind from blowing in when someone enters. The toilet was probably the biggest improvement in the restaurant. Very clean and roomy. It had a sliding door which made using on my own very easy. The staff were great, explaining the menu and how the dishes were made. "

Dakota Glasgow,"Dakota Glasgow Top-quality. This was my first visit to the Dakota hotel in Glasgow. I had visited their hotel at euro central, it's just off the M8 motorway on the way to Motherwell, so I knew what standard to expect and I wasn't disappointed.
Their buildings look like something from Gotham city in a Batman movie. Being in the heart of Glasgow on street parking can be quite limited. There is an NCP car park on Holland Street which is a few hundred yards away. Due to its proximity to Sauchiehall St. it has a good bus service from most parts of the city. Charing Cross train station is not too far. There is level access to the building. It has automatic doors at the entrance. The restaurant was in the basement accessed by a lift, this was the one disappointing aspect, I could fit my wheelchair in but the two guests with me had to squeeze in. The toilet in the restaurant was very clean and was of a reasonable size. The staff were excellent, very attentive and helpful. Sauchiehall Street is the first of Glasgow's 'avenues project'. This is making the public realm more pedestrian friendly, and it's definitely more attractive. I have heard that the cycle lanes and shared space do cause problems for people with a visual impairment. When moving along the street in my "
Turkiye EFES,"Turkiye EFES Accessible Turkish restaurant in the middle of Glasgow. Very nice staff and delicious food in a pretty accessible restaurant 5 mins from George Square on foot/wheels I seem to remember (through the haze of Turkish wine) a wee ramp at the front door from the pavement. Then there was an inner door, which unhelpfully opens outwards into the space that you're in - might be a challenge for wheelchairs - staff very helpful though. Plenty of space between tables, and t Accessible loo at entry level and easy to get to. Quite tight inside. Loads of grab rails. Very smiley and helpful. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and the portions were huge. As a result we had to leave an embarrassing amount of food untouched. Dessert was definitely not an option!"
Tesco Extra,"Tesco Extra Very open, good accessibility.Overall, Tesco Maryhill has great wheelchair accessibility with lifts up into the store, very helpful staff ready to assist if you need any help, i learned that there is a sign language course that some members of staff have completed and they now know basic sign langua yes, there are lots of disabled spots right at the front door and its covered so good for bad weather. there is signage to nearest lift which isnt far, there is also a travellator (flat escalator) and stairs. there is a cafe upstairs also if you wish to stop and have a rest mid shop. very accessible, well signed, very big and tidy, hand rails and emergency pull. everyone is very helpful in Maryhill Store they are happy to help with anything you may need, nothing is a bother. they only thing i wish they would do widen the aisles and possibly selfscan. other than that its perfect."
The Corinthian Club,The Corinthian Club Restaurant bar casino in beautiful old and largely accessible building with stunning architecture. Need to enter through a side entrance having asked them to open the door but once inside the Venue is largely accessible with several disabled toilets and flat access to main bars and private function  It is in central Glasgow with all those restrictions you would respect with very limited on-street parking but with some local public transport including Queen Street station close by. Also no parking directly outside the main entrance means getting in and out of cabs made easier You cannot get up the large flight of steps into the Victorian building but they do have ramped access to the side but you need to ask at the reception for the door to be opened. Once in the building much of it seems to be accessible certainly most tables in the main bar restaurant (freestanding or  Accessible toilets on the ground floor needing lift therefore if you are in Casino or private function rooms but the toilet that I visited was well kitted out though probably not that large. It was clean tidy and uncluttered Without exception all very helpful guiding us through restaurants and bars helping with the lifts and offering help Very atmospheric place and you must look up if you're in the main bar as the ceiling and glass dome are stunning. We had a set menu for a function but food was lovely.
Victoria’s Secret,"Victoria’s Secret Scotland’s first Victoria’s Secret has good access. Even during busy sales shopping I had a very comfortable experience and looking forward to going back We parked a little while away behind Buchanan street. There are some blue badge spaces dotted around the city centre but you have to be lucky to catch one. There is also multi-storey parking available nearby It is level access into the first floor of the store and steps down into a larger area. The security guard and staff showed me as soon as I came in where the lift was and to say if I need anything at all - but not in an overbearing way. The majority of displays and drawers are low down and I could r n/a Security, check out and floor assistants all really nice and helpful. "
Scottish Football Museum and Hampden Stadium Tour,"Scottish Football Museum and Hampden Stadium Tour National Football Museum. The access to Hampden Park is fully accessible, being a large stadia there is ample parking that is disabled designated and welcomes blue badge holders too. If you are taking the train or bus it’s a lengthy trek. The venue is 2.5 miles from Glasgow City Centre. Being a spor Ample parking with designated bays, train or bus is not close, train 750 m bus 500m steep inclines and descents to and from the stadium. Limited signage, for visitors to the museum this is more than adequate via lifts, doors are wide as the concourse areas As the museum is in the main stand where the hospitality  rooms, function suites and administration are located the toilets are fully andwell appointed with plenty space.
However if you are a spectator in the other stands, a totally different and disappointing story. Although there were 2 Guides on hand they were not keen to  interact or engage unless you made the initial prompt or contact. It would have been difficult to get a clear and full description if you did not already have a knowledge and understading of the sport. There are lots of interactive opportunities for children and young people, the time lines used for the pathway of Club and National Football is well presented as it highlights the entwined impact the game has on communities, their identity from street to playground or public park."
Bellahouston Park,"Bellahouston Park Sixty eight acres !. An enormous green space in the middle of a sprawling city. The park has several places where you can park, walk, explore and visit the attractions. Parking is avaialble in two main car parks at the House for an Art Lover off Dumbreck Road and at Bellahouston Sports Centre off Bellahouston Drive. Given the size of the park these are not close to all attractions. Getting around the park could be quite exhausting and there are some fairly steep slopes to negotiate if you want to go up to the wooded area in the middle. That said the paths are well maintained and as a powerchiar user they were easy to navigate. Accessible toilets are in the main attractions including the House of an Art Lover and the Leisure Centre.   Bellahouston Park Well managed, great staff and a brilliant experience. An all round excellent experience! 

From the moment we arrived, we could tell how much thought had been put into accessibility. Firstly, there was a separate entrance for accessible ticket holders. The street that this entrance was on was used     "
Wee Lochan,"Wee Lochan Nice things come in small packages. Very cozy restaurant with level access from street. Staff are very accommodating which make a restaurant that could be a tight squeeze, very comfortable. Although it is on a Main Street there are plenty of on street parking spaces in the surrounding residential streets offering free level access parking. Level access into the restaurant with a very light door easily manoeuvrable in my manual wheelchair. The staff were over immediately to find us an accessible table. NA I didn't use the toilet facilities. The staff were fantastic from start to finish. Even finding somewhere to store my wheelchair (in a packed full restaurant) when I preferred to transfer into a more comfortable seat. Very impressed. Wee lochan has a great welcoming atmosphere with a range of original pictures on display for sale. This kept us going throughout the meal!"
Dobbies Garden Centre Milngavie,"Dobbies Garden Centre Milngavie Nice centre with good variety, and a great pianist in the cafe!. Nice garden centre with generally good wheelchair access. Café with fairly good wheelchair access. Concessions could do more to make their areas accessible for wheelchairs as some displays too cramped to get through, but the Dobbies pa Lots of disabled spaces, but when we visited there was only one space left and as usual many of the spaces were occupied  by vehicles not displaying blue badges. Spaces to the right of the main entrance give better access for wheelchairs as you don't have to do the ramp up to the door from that side Generally good access round the garden centre inside and out, although the concession areas (Edinburgh Woollen Mill etc) need to give more thought to how they lay out displays so that wheelchairs have easy access - we gave up with those areas. However, the parts controlled by Dobbies have good acces Easy to find,  but seems to be used as a parent and child loo as well so don't be surprised if you have to queue! Generally pretty good although not as helpful as at Dobbies Dalgety Bay or Livingston. The pianist in the café at lunchtime was amazing! Don't know if he's always there or if this was just a special occasion. It's not in Milngavie! (despite the name!) Check your directions before you go!"
Ness Clothing,Ness Clothing Clothing for the ladies. Easy to get in and space to get around as a wheelchair user.  Getting into the store was easy as it is level access straight from the Galleries. You can move around and see most things although it is a bit of a zig zag to make your way around. Accessible toilets are available in the Galleries. Helpful staff happy to show things that may be out of reach or view. 
Non Viet,"Non Viet Vietnamese food done properly. I went with a friend who spends some time in Vietnam every year, he said the food was very authentic.
This part of Sauchiehall Street has been developed as part of the 'Avenues project' in the city center, big, big improvement. Parking in this area of the city can be quite difficult. There are two bus stops nearby, it's is a great bus service to most parts of the city from here. It is level access to these premises. At the entrance the first door opens inwards the second one opens towards you, for a lot of people this would be difficult, for a wheelchair user it is the ultimate obstacle. I had someone with me and the staff came to help so wasn't so much of an issue. Toilet was very spacious and clean. The one issue I would have is it had a thumb lock, for someone with dexterity problems they can be a real problem. The staff were great, very helpful. "
Bank of Scotland,Bank of Scotland Modern and spacious. Easy access at ground level with automatic door.  Large open plan set up with plenty of space.  Most of the cashiers are behind fairly high desks but there are also low tables available. is on a pedestrianised street no parking outside but is close to numerous bus stops and also few minutes from Buchanan Street underground. Easy access because no step and has automatic doors.  Lots of room to manoeuvre because of open plan setup. There is a toilet but it is not accessible. Staff really friendly and they are happy to assist in any way they can. 
Costa Coffee,"Costa Coffee Costa Coffee at The Hub, East Kilbride Shopping Centre. Great open space location with great physical access, lighting and comfort With a bus station 5 minutes from the nearest entrance, two level car park with a good amount of disabled parking spaces.
The only minus is the prices for parking before 6pm, but it’s free after that. Access to the Shopping Centre is quite good, with automatic doors, ramps and large spaces. The Costa itself is situated in the centre of the ground floor of the Hub, with good space for a wheelchair to manoeuvre, comfortable seats that can be moved and different types of tables The Costa itself doesn’t have loo facilities but there are two very good accessible Loos just 2 minutes away. Sadly the only changing place loo is only situated in the other end of the shopping centre The staff is quite friendly, helpful and accommodating. They deal with many disabled people with good care, but they are not trained in disability awareness and they do not have BSL "
Chaophraya,"Chaophraya Nice Thai Restaurant. The restaurant is accessible, but typically requires you to make a number of floor level changes during a visit. Somewhat annoying, but understandable in an older building.

Stack & Still Braehead,"Stack & Still Braehead Pancakes Galore. Level access pancake restaurant on the ground floor level of the Braehead shopping centre. When you visit Braehead shopping centre it is free to park here and there are lots of parking spaces. The day I visited it was raining so I parked in the inside parking area next to M&S from here I was able go up the lift and into the shopping centre without getting wet from the rain. The only thing There are no steps to enter this restaurant and it is level access throughout. The restaurant is all open in the shopping centre and is very spacious. I was very happy to see that we were being seated at a circular table as I feel they are easier to get into with my wheelchair controller and I feel  I can’t comment on the toilets here as I didn’t use them but I didn’t see any in the restaurant. There are definitely disabled toilets in the shopping restaurant and as far as I can see online there is also a Changing Place toilet. I would say that the staff members I interact with at Stack and Still were friendly. I wouldn’t say I’m very fussy when I comes to how food is made or anything but my side of halloumi fries that I had were very dry and didn’t come with any dipping sauce which they usually do when I’ve had them in other restaurants. Also I didn’t feel our pancake was presented the best, I thought the"
East Kilbride Library,"East Kilbride Library Great Library. Situated in the East Kilbride Shopping Centre, with a car park and a bus station minutes away, the East Kilbride Central Library is a great library with good access. it is situated near to the bus station with access ramps and lift to the building but it is quite expensive parking if you need to be at the library all day. The Library is suited with good access to physical and mental disabilities, there are a good choice of audio books and other resources. sadly not many of the staff seems to have BSL skills. You have accessible loos but you will need to  get out of the library and use the Shopping Centre accessible loos that are 5 minutes away Staff is quite friendly and used to deal with different disabilities, they have a dedicated person when they have a group of people with disabilities.

The Butchershop Bar & Grill,The Butchershop Bar & Grill Butchershop Bar and Grill review. Don't get me wrong this is a nice restaurant situated adjacent to the wonderful Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery. The staff were very kind and offered to help on the way out of the restaurant. However I have majors gripes about the wheelchair access because I was  The parking is hard because the west end of Glasgow always has this bustle about it and no matter what you cannnot get a parking space. There was no ramp access there was a step leading up into the restaurant. The staff were helpful and aided me leaving the restaurant. There was also no disabled toilets which they claimed were installing which I don't believe. No disabled toilets in sight. The staff explained there was none which was infuriating. The staff were kind and understanding and give me assistance on my way out. 
The Butterfly and the Pig,"The Butterfly and the Pig Banging bands. All you need in one place.
Good bar if you're just after a drink. Tasty hearty food, weekend breakfast menu always a treat.
I don't know how they source their bands but sat/suñ nights are always rocking. Get yourself along.
Staff are great, they'll do their best to get you a table  On the main road in busy Shawlands, bus transport great. Parking not great in Shawlands, best get a taxi and have a beer. Main door accessible with no steps. Stewards on most nights and always helpful. Very large room but toilet only use from one side but plenty of room for any carer.. Always kept clean. Always helpful It's my local so I'll definitely be back"
Caffè Nero,"Caffè Nero Lunch at Caffè Nero. Great parking, spacious enough inside and really helpful staff. We had 3 manual wheelchair users in our group and we're easily accommodated. There are plenty of disabled parking bays in the retail park to use. There is a slight slope when entering the front doors, which makes it quite difficult to open the doors independently. There was an accessible loo with handrails that made it quite simple for me to use. It could be quite cramped for someone with a buggy or larger wheelchair. Very impressed with the staff who couldn't do enough to help during our visit. The hot chocolates and croissants were fantastic. Highly recommended!"
Maze (Alice in Wonderland) - Bellahouston Park,"Maze (Alice in Wonderland) - Bellahouston Park Getting lost the easy way. The maze is level access from the main walkway through the park. The paths are gravel and this is firm enough to wheel over. Parking is some considerable distance away. The nearest is by the House of an Art Lover. If you don't mind walking to get there it is worth a visit. Very popular with younger children, the maze is accessible as a wheelchair user. There are no toilets but the park has facilities in the House of an Art Lover and the Palace of Art Centre.  "
Sugo Pasta,"Sugo Pasta top nosh. Sugo is a new Italian restaurant in Glasgow City center. It is not your usual Italian, it focuses on quality rather than quantity. There are only 9 dishes on the menu but I could've chosen and enjoyed any of them. I've been here twice, once having the veal ravioli and the other having the  Although there is no transport links in Mitchell Lane there are plenty close by on Union and Argyle Street, central station is a couple of hundred yards away. There is a NCP car park across the road. Access to the restaurant is via a glass door that opens towards you, it is a busy restaurant so there is always people available to help. They have an accessible toilet. It's not the biggest but I was able to get in in my electric wheelchair, the one problem with it was my pet hate, the flush on the far side nearest the wall that you cannot reach from a wheelchair. There are plenty of staff, very helpful and always attentful. This is my new favorite restaurant. It seats 200 people and you never have to wait too long for a table. You can't book but if it's too busy you can go away and they will text you when your table is ready."
Monorail Music,"Monorail Music Glasgow's best record shop, hands down.Monorail is a staple of mine, if I'm in the city I must go and have a word with the bank manager too. Ran by the Glasgow indie darlings The Pastels from the 80's/90s. 

It's a selection of great music from all genres and places that the band like. So any resp Pretty much city centre, just off the Merchant City. Carpark is pretty much right beside it. About a 15min walk from Queen Street station It's alll pretty much accessible with a ramp in and all on same level. Need to check. Always very friendly and helpful. In the summer it's nice to sit out at the front with everyone in a good mood enjoying a drink."

The Walled Garden,The Walled Garden Lovely gardens. To get into the gardens you have a choice of three entrances. We came in from adjacent to the Blue Badge parking area. It was fairly level access once inside; albeit sloped in places. Parking was in the Blue Badge parking area. From there it was a fifty metre walk into the Walled Garden. The parking area was confusing as the lines on the ground didn't clearly indicate where to park. Getting out of the vehicle you had to cross over a thin line of cobble like stones to get onto the Four stars as once you get in it is easy to wheel around and see the beautifully kept gardens. The bright colours and carefully cropped lawns were impressive. There are benches dotted around if you want to stop for a while and admire the views. The grounds are set on an incline so you may want to st There is an accessible loo in the nearby House of an Art Lover. It comes with the challenges of getting into the house and negotiating the corridor - see the separate reviews. No staff were in evidence during our visit 
BrewDog Merchant City,"BrewDog Merchant City Doggy treats. Great pub, good beers, tasty treats I came by foot (chair) from the Trongate, which is about about 10 minutes away.
The area is quite pedestrianised, so not much parking. Buses to, and from the east and west of the city are are a couple of hundred yards from the venue.
It is in the heart of the city centre, so fairly good for taxis, Access to, and within the premises are on the level. There was an accessible toilet, easy to use and had a handle lock. It was slightly dirty, but it was a Saturday evening and obviously had a lot of traffic throughout the day. It was a Saturday evening and quite busy.

Starbucks,"Starbucks 4 star-bucks. Although the store has level access throughout the store, the number of tables creates quite a cramped space making it difficult to move around in my wheelchair. Plenty of accessible parking bays directly outside the store. Access to the counter for take away was fine for me but some people may struggle with the height of the counter and using the card machine. Moving through the table section can be quite difficult as it is quite cramped which would have been difficult if it was busier. Accessible toilets at the rear of the store were ideal. The positioning could be a little better as people would be required to pass through the cramped seating area to get to access the toilet in the first place. Very pleasant staff who immediately offered to take our drinks to our chosen seat with a constant smile. Great customer service. "

Topolabamba,"Topolabamba Bringing a little taste of Mexico to Glasgow!. This is an accessible restaurant in Glasgow's city centre. It is a very lively place, with a warm welcome from all when you arrive. Tables are very close together, which makes for a great atmosphere, but not so great for getting around with mobility aid Parking is quite difficult in this area. There is on street parking available, but it is extremely busy. Public transport is very straight forward. There are lots of bus and train routes into the town centre. Queen Street station and Central Station are both within walking distance. There is a very clear sign outside, so finding the restaurant was easy enough. There are two glass doors to enter, which need to be opened manually. This made it a little difficult for me getting into the restaurant. Once inside, there didn't seem to be many seating options for wheelchair users. Par There was an accessible loo at the rear of the restaurant. It had a sliding door which could have been tricky for some, but it had everything I needed from a loo. I thought the staff were superb. From the minute we walked through the front door, we were made to feel very welcome. Can't speak highly enough about them! The food is fantastic in here, but be sure to keep the water topped up as it is pretty spicy. Hope you enjoy it!"

There is a ramp upon entry into the place which c If you are already in Glasgow City Centre, then the restaurant is wheel-able distance for me, I was near Central Station before going there and it was a relatively flat wheel there and back, because it is Glasgow City Centre there is no parking nearby, I would recommend getting a taxi if you can't w There is a ramp on entry to the restaurant this has a slight couple of lips in so you may get stuck if you've not got foresight of these, the door also opens towards you, it may be difficult for you to get in if you are alone. Once inside we were situated at the long table by the door and I slotted  Can't comment on this as didn't use the bathroom facilities at all. Will ask next time I'm there and update accordingly. Staff were very attentive and helpful. "
The Emirates Arena Café,"The Emirates Arena Café Great accessible meeting place if you have a car!. A great accessible cafe and meeting place, with lots of space. Its just at the entrance and before the barriers to get into the Arena/Velodrome/Gym so you can meet there without having to pay to go in. The only downside is the transport. Its no grea Its a hard one to judge here. Great if you drive as there are lots of bays, but there is no public transport to the Arena, which I find very weird given how new and big the facility is.  I was told by Traveline that the nearest bus stops at the forge, which is 10-15mins up the hill, so not ideal at  Very straightforward access into the venue. Cafe is just at the entrance. There is a good accessible loo just beside the cafe Staff were very friendly. We didn't need any assistance as access was very straightforward. Cakes are homemade and pretty good!"
Harvester Hillington,"Harvester Hillington Access Review. Spacious inside restaurant with easy entrance.  The tables are at a good  height for your wheelchair to get under. Parking is good, with 5 or 6 disabled accessible bays. Good size of restaurant to manoeuvre around. The accessible toilet is good, reasonably sized for a disabled person and their PA. Staff are helpful and very friendly. "
Clyde Walkway and Millennium Bridge,Clyde Walkway and Millennium Bridge Great views of the Clyde. Surprisingly good access to be found along the riverside walkway and across the Millennium Bridge We used taxis to take us to the  Tall Ship and then walked along the riverside path on our exploring. It's probably easier to join the path at the SECC or BBC plaza. Surprisingly good surfaces to wheel along and step free. Plenty of room to walk along and have a conversation rather than having to wheel in the usual train formation No toilets en route other then in some of the buildings. Not applicable if you cross the bridge to the south side of the river you're outside the BBC building and next to the Glasgow Science Centre
Simply Health Great Women's Run,"Simply Health Great Women's Run Girl Power!!. Incredible annual women's running event held in Glasgow. Now starting and finishing in Kelvingrove Park (the run previously took place in the South Side), there's many city sights to take in, including the park itself, Kelvingrove Museum, SEC, BBC studios, Science Centre, and running a The race happens in the city, so if you live nearby it's no problem.
While there are buses and underground to the area, remember that the run is held on a Sunday morning, and public transport often starts later on a Sunday.

It may be easier to drive, there is no specific parking directly at the  This did not seem a particular accessible event, especially for those with physical disabilities.
The event website does not give accessibility information, and suggests you email them directly. It does say that many of their events are not wheelchair accessible.

In my opinion, people with other Here come the port-a-loos!
Never the most luxurious experience, but they serve an essential need!
As well as a bank of standard loos, there were accessible port-a-loos near the start of the race. There are staff, but it is also the many volunteers who are the  hero's of events like this.
There were marshals throughout the course, directing people, and ready to offer assistance if required. There is first aid and medical support if needed. Amazing atmosphere and an event which gives you a sense of achievement to complete.

Piper's at each kilometre, music and dancers along the route, as well as lots of support from the public, really keeps you motivated.

Perhaps the organisers could look at ways of making it a bit more accessible"
Filling Station,"Filling Station Access Review. It isn't really well designed for wheelchair users because of the amount unaccessible tables.  There isn't a lot of room to pass when wheelchair is parked at the table. Disabled parking is good with plenty of spaces on the upper level,  lower level and in the multi storey. Disabled access is reasonable but  i think it could  be improved. There is a disabled toilet but i haven't used it, therefore i can't really rate it. Staff are really friendly, helpful and are  relatively quick. "
Tinto Tapas Bar Glasgow West End,"Tinto Tapas Bar Glasgow West End friendly tapas bar. Largely accessible venue with pleasant, helpful staff and good, reasonably priced food On street parking adjacent door to restaurant but can be busy venue all on ground level and with no steps (other than to the non-disabled toilets) but think a wheelchair would need a bit of careful manoeuvring to get through the front doors but not impossible. Although there is a disabled toilet on the ground level, Iit's not perfect. I would avoid the booths  big enough and fine for somebody with walking stick etc but a bit crowded with stored equipment. But for somebody in a wheelchair it would be bit difficult to access as at the rear of restaurant and would perhaps need staff to move items around toilet door and possibly in the toilet itself helpful, chatty, and very pleasant "

Papyrus,"Papyrus Great shop for stuff you always needed but don't really.This is a great shop on byre's road selling all types of homeware and gifts. Its dangerous going in after a few drinks as you'll end up up buying stuff you think you'll need but on reflect.... did I really need that dachshund tea towel?! Right on Byres Road, 2 minute walk from the subway. The first floor is mostly gifts, wrapping paper and cards - this all has level access.
The basement only has access via stairs below, this is where all the kitchen utilities are sold.
Upstairs seems to have more space around the stands and so on.  Really helpful and polite and went out of their way to help and wrap everything up properly. "

La Vita Spuntini West End,"La Vita Spuntini West End Wee Italian Lunch. Lunch with friend and her 2 carers and my PA On Byres Rd in West End of Glasgow, so parked behind Jinty McGintys. Car park was really steep but was free with blue badge. it was a wee bit of a squeeze to get in and get to my table, but social distancing was being adhered to. Had to get lady behind me.to move so that I could reverse chair out.  Lots of staff but always had to try and get their attention. Our young waiter tried his best but spilt some of my mussells onto his shirt and the tray. Staff could have been a bit more on it.. Food was really good.

Caledonian Sleeper - Glasgow - London,"Caledonian Sleeper - Glasgow - London A vast improvement, but still some way to go.This was my first trip on board the new Caledonian Sleeper rolling stock. Having used the previous rolling stock on a regular basis, I was excited to see what this one had in store, accessibility wise. The booking process was easy, I booked about 2 weeks  Access to Central Station is easy by public transport. I am not a wheelchair user, therefore I didn't require a ramp. But, on the whole, I found access to be generally good. I've given it four stars because my host didn't have the key to get into the cabin and didn't seem to know how to access it for a while. 

There is a light dimmer, bright reading  The accessible toilet is adequate, but I'm extremely disappointed that it isn't en suite with a shower as advertised in rooms for non-disabled guests. The turning space in the toilet would be enough for a small powerchair or a manual wheelchair user, but there certainly isn't enough room for a large Staff were extremely helpful and assisted me in filling in my menu card when I arrived. I was shown where all the important amenities were in my room but I wasn't shown how to get to the lounge car. There are a few annoyances from my journey. They are as follows:
1. There is no large print material on board, so the menu card and the room service menu were inaccessible to me. 
2. Whilst there is a USB socket at the head of the bed, the plug sockets at the foot of the bed may be hard to reach f"

Premier Inn Glasgow City Centre George Square,"Premier Inn Glasgow City Centre George Square Pretty good. I'd definitely stay here again - very convenient for George Square and centre of Glasgow My train came in to Queen Street Station and the hotel was a couple of minutes along on the other side of George Street - on the corner with Montrose St (decent pavement and easy pedestrian crossings which give you plenty of time to cross). It looked like a taxi could stop right outside. The main door is up several steps, but there's an external lift just to the side. Quite tight. When you get up to the level of the foyer, to enter the building you have to exit the lift and go through a glass door which proclaims itself to be automatic. When I was there it failed to open automatical   "
Glasgow 2014 Superstore,"Glasgow 2014 Superstore Glasgow 2014 anyone?. A pop up store in the middle of Glasgow's George Square. Access is fair but could do much better.  Visiting having arrived at the nearby Queen Street station it was actually hard to find the door to get in. It's on the far side of the Square but wasn't well signposted or we couldn't see it as powerchair users.

There are two doors to get in and out of the superstore but it was only luck that ha No toilets. There were plenty of staff on hand although they didn't offer any assistance or even help to find the way out. Getting out was a challenge as there's one way out and one way in but this is not obvious. In order to wheel out you have to join the queue to pass the till area as this is cordoned off. It's not that wide in places. Disappointed that the watching staff did not offer assistance at this point to nego"

The Ivy Buchanan Street,"The Ivy Buchanan Street Great food but a bit 'hoity-toity'. The Ivy is part of the large Ivy group that has restaurants all over Britain. They promote their restaurants as being sophisticated and relaxed. I love my food and this place does serve good quality dishes but for me  the place is bit pompous. Being in the center of Glasgow means there is good transport links. Buses, trains and subway [inaccessible for wheelchairs] are all close by.
There are disabled parking bays in St. Vincent Place about 100 yards away. The doors had to be held open for me but being in Buchanan Street meant there was plenty of people around. 
Tables are fairly quite close so moving about is quite difficult. I had booked so they knew I was coming and had given me a suitable table. The table supports had round basis which makes it a The toilet was spacious and very clean. Although I have no complaints about the staff, I felt they were also a bit pompous. If you like your food and you would like a fancy night out, this is a good choice. I just prefer my dining a bit more casual."
Chateau-X,"Chateau-X Good food and 99% flat. Teeny step at front entrance but flat inside.Amazing £12 steaks on a Monday in January :) 
The restaurant is in finnieston and on the flat, for Glasgow standards.
I attended with sticks as my cousin was picking me up but I was checking it out to take my manual chair in future There was no parking outside and was busy. I got dropped off.
I looked for a drop kerb and could not see one. 
A taxi with ramp to pavement may be best option.
If there was a drop kerb, the cars had parked along it. There is a small step at front entrance, about 2cm. Just a bit bigger than a drop kerb but not big in wheelchair terms.
(May need a tiny bump up or wheelie if you have small wheels)
There are double doors but only one was open so both would need to me open.
After the first tiny step, there are no mo Decent modern loo with grab rails. Not huge for a side transfer but enough room to turn. 
Clean and tidy. Not used as secondary storage etc. A toilet that is a toilet! Friendly, attentive, helpful. My cousin had organised a cake for me and the staff accommodated it singing and smiling.
Can't fault the staff service. "

Tesco Superstore,"Tesco Superstore Review of Tesco Craigmarloch's Wheelchair access.On arrival I was very pleased to see that the shop was one level and had disabled parking very close to the shop entrance. This ensures easy accessibility to all areas of the shop, including the café. All aisles of the store bar a couple were wide eno Tesco Craigmarloch had very good disabled parking. It was in a close range to the entrance to the store but enough distance apart from other parking bays, allowing for any procedures to be carried out with ease. In terms of bus services these were every thirty minutes. I would not recommend using th Signage was very well posted when accessing the store. As the store was one level it was very easy to manoeuvre around. The only fault in terms of the store would have to be not having access to all of the aisles due to there being pillars obstructing them. There was a toilet, although it was not sign posted very well. It was rather on the small size so I am sure manoeuvring within it would be very difficult for both the user and carer. The toilet was not clean and lacked basic sanitary products, such as a working Hand dryer and clean soap. The locks o The staff were very friendly and helpful. "

Andiamo,"Andiamo Italian. an Italian restaurant, it's one of three Andiamo's in the Glasgow area. Fenwick Road has a great 38 bus route, they are every 5/10 minutes. It's also on the Ayr bus route.
There is not a lot of on street parking but Giffnock train station is just around the corner, it has a large car park. There is level access to the premises. You would need a hand negotiating the two doors if you're using a wheelchair.
There are plenty of tables and the staff were very accommodating finding me somewhere suitable. The toilet was very spacious. Clean and tidy. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good Italian food. A nice south side restaurant."
Tony Macaroni,"Tony Macaroni Easy access. Tony Macaroni is an Italian restaurant within Silverburn shopping center. Being in a shopping center it has level access and no doors to enter the restaurant, perfect for anybody with mobility issues. There is ample parking with plenty of accessible spaces. Silverburn has its own bus terminus a couple of hundred yards from an entrance, so plenty of buses. As I said, level access and no doors. Toilet was clean and tidy. There was a door to enter the corridor to the toilets but there is plenty of staff and people about to give you a hand. It had a sliding door to enter the toilet. The staff were helpful and pleasant. I've been in Tony macaroni's before and the food was fantastic, this time, mehh."
Riverhill Coffee Bar,"Riverhill Coffee Bar Coffee and Cakes Galore. Riverhill is a regular haunt for me with amazing coffee and food. The cakes are AMAZING with plenty for all dietary requirements. However, even though the staff are a delight who are always happy to help an chat access is limited if you are a wheelchair user or have mobility The venue is in the heart of Glasgow city centre. There is a NCP car just a few metres away and also trains and busses all within a very short distance. There are also parking spaces outside the shop but they seem to be like gold dust and probably a little tricky to get one. There is a slight step up into the shop and the actual door space is pretty small I imagine it would be difficult accessing the shop if you were in a wheelchair or required an assistive aid. Again in terms of access for wheelchairs or assistive aids particular with mobility issues these toilets are not accessible they are down a steep and spiralling stair case. The staff are fantastic! They are such a lovely bunch and will really go above and beyond to accommodate, unfortunately its just limited by the small size of the shop ad poor access to amenities. This is a great place if you love good coffee, food and chat. I can't praise the staff enough. However access is limited if you require disabled access and amenities are not easily accessible which let it down."
Clockwork Bar and Restaurant,"Clockwork Bar and Restaurant Good Access For Average Food. Recently refurbished pub is very big so has good spaces between tables and chairs.

Opal Moon,"Opal Moon Beautiful wee shop with helpful staff. A beautiful, tiny wee shop in Queen Margaret Drive selling crystals, fairies, tarrot and all things mystical. Quirky and cute. Parking is on street and all depends on you being lucky! Also there is a distinct lack of dropped kerbs but the pavement is negotiable. 
Approach to this shop is not brilliant but it is possible to travel by powerchair from Great Western Road or the nearby Botanic Gardens. The shop does not appear accessible at first. There is a rather large step, but as soon as you pass by the window and hover about for a second, a staff member will appear with a ramp as if by magic! ;)
Once inside the shop is tiny but you can turn a chair in there and have a good look around. Again N/A First class service. Attentive without being intrusive. No pushy sales techniques, just genuine helpful folk who will go to any length required to help you get exactly what you want. I know this is a shop and not a venue but I had to submit this review as I believe that little independent shops that go above and beyond most others to provide equality of access and suberb customer service to all, deserves to get the praise it's due. Too often these little shops in old buildings c"

There is slightly ramped access to the restaurant.

Lush,"Lush A Sensory Invasion. The entrance to the store was wide and level but getting around was a challenge. The store is in a pedestrianised area. The store is bright and certainly colourful.

Morrisons Cafe,"Morrisons Cafe Handy Cafe. Next to all the public transport, this Morrison's Cafe is in a very handy place in Partick. 
You can enter the Cafe through its own doors, or from a door linking it from the main Morrison's supermarket. Right next to all the public transport:
Partick train station is to one side, and the  bus station is directly opposite.
Partick is one of the main train stations, and one where you can change lines etc. The underground station is within the same building. So it is a bit of a transport hub.

There i Flat entrance from street into cafe. Push button (at good wheelchair height) to open automatic doors. 
Fairly small cafe, so if busy could be a bit tight in places if trying to move in a bigger wheelchair/scooter. 
Bright seating, inviting place. The toilets are at the back of the cafe, you have to be able to get past both the queue of people getting served, and a row of tables on your other side. Bit of a tight squeeze! 
There are two toilets, both of which are accessible but are also intended for all customers to use. Therefore there was a I didn't have much interaction with the staff as only bought a drink. Unless you already live in the area, you are unlikely to make a specific trip here - you probably have a supermarket cafe nearer your home! 
However due to its location, its useful to know about.
Instead of waiting around in the cold for my train, I'll pop in here for a cup of tea or snack."

You can approach the Square from all directions and there are lowered kerbs. The surface is tarmac and smooth enough to wheel across.   "
Premier Inn Glasgow City Centre Charing Cross,"Premier Inn Glasgow City Centre Charing Cross Cheap and centrally located. We were going to a gig which was due to finish at midnight and we didn't fancy a bus back at time time to Edinburgh.

The room was booked before and was relatively cheap - though we did not ask for an accessible room, so this review is based on me being a bit wobbly, b We walked there about 12minutes from Queens Street Station. Charring Cross Train Station is literally right beside and below the train station. There was a side ramp up the front entrance. Lift to all floors, bar is up on the Mezzanine, which was spacious but we didn't use. Our room was on the sixth floor and it was spacious. It was not an accessible bathroom as we did not ask for it, the shower was over the bath - which I never like.  Very nice and happy, there was a major three day festival on the hotel was really busy but they coped well. For the price and location it was very good, though the constant noise of the motorway going way could be annoying to some or soothing to others!"

Hollywood Bowl,"Hollywood Bowl Great fun at Hollywood Bowl. A fun family day out at bowling with wheelchair access throughout. There was also arcades, bar, diner and pool tables all wheelchair accessible. There is a large carpark as Hollywood Bowl is located at Glasgow Springfield Quay so there are also restaurants. We managed to park directly outside the entrance. The entrance was level access and completely step-free. The doors aren't automatic though. As soon as you enter the building you are in the arcades and the bar/diner are immediately on the right. Follow the path around and you'll see the reception desk to get booked in. There was a lowered section a There was an accessible toilet, which had a radar key - excellent. The toilet was very clean, but it was way too small. I need assistance from someone to lift me out of my wheelchair, to the toilet and back in my wheelchair. The small space made transferring very difficult as there was barely any ro All staff were very friendly and helpful. Always happy to help. I would definitely go back again to the bowling, but the accessible toilet is an issue so that could possibly sway my decision."

Bar Home,"Bar Home Great choice. No one can deny bar home has tried to make itself an accessible bar in a great area in Glasgow. Albion street has street parking and relatively good paths, with a heavy glass door it is a little awkward to get into but its wide with a slight ramp. The bar is open during the day and ser No parking of its own but lots of nearby street parking and town car park at too of the road however I wouldn't recommend using that as the ground is very uneven. Slip ramp on entry only issue is the door (push or pull) spacious (when quiet) easy to access disabled toilet. Radar key system (they only have one key) good bathroom with expected bars etc. on the time of visit no cleaning equipment was using the toilet as a store cupboard. Staff were very helpful. Had no issues. Very difficult to leave during busy time of Friday night as such a great location for pre drinks on night out.  The ramped entrance isn't an alternative but permanent feature."

Lidl,"Lidl Grocery shopping mart. Wheelchair mobility and access is restrictive. Public transport would be the most ideal way of getting there.

The entrance had automatic doors and no steps which made it easily accessible. However, the aisles are very narrow and maneuverability is definitely a problem. Especially when there is more than one person along the aisle.  Staff are friendly, approachable and helpful as well. "
Ho Wong,"Ho Wong Great Chinese restaurant. The old Ho Wong closed a couple of years ago due to the building being demolished. The new one, although housed in a modern building,  has lost none of the charm and the food was still utterly delicious. There is on street parking but it is a very busy business area so could not vouch  for how  easy parking would be during the week. Hope Street, which is very well served by many bus routes is a few hundred yards away, so is Glasgow central train station. Apart from a step at the front door moving around inside the restaurant was very easy. There is a side door with level access. The accessible loo was easy to move around and very clean. I loved the sign on the door, see picture attached.  We had the lunchtime special which is great value."
Spill The Beans,"Spill The Beans A good meeting place. Very large coffee shop with plenty of different seating catering for all. There is on street parking but it can be quite difficult getting a spot with its central location in Shawlands. There are plenty of buses/bus stops close by on Kilmarnock Rd. There is step free access to the premises. With the coffee shop being so big it is easy moving around inside. There are seats on the pavement outside and also ramped access to a seating area at the back. Clean well maintained accessible toilet. There are always plenty of staff. They are always helpful and attentive. It's a great place for a sandwich, cake or just some tasty nibbles."
Travelodge Glasgow Paisley Road Hotel,"Travelodge Glasgow Paisley Road Hotel Travelodge Glasgow Paisley Road Hotel. Was looking for a budget hotel near the Clyde for ICW wrestling in November, if you're looking for a cheap hotel near the SSE Hydro, I would defiantly recommend this hotel. The hotel provided the basic bed we needed. The hotel was a bit shabby, with an aroma of There is no specific disabled car parking but the hotel has private parking so it is not a long walk to the hotel! Ramp to get into the hotel and the wheelchair accessible room is on ground level so easy to locate your room. Great accessible toilet with plenty of room for maneuverer. The staff are nice and helpful but they can sometimes not be at the front desk and they can take 10 minutes to finally appear. "

Glasgow HM Passport Office,"Glasgow HM Passport Office Essential visit. On paper it all sounded very easy with auto doors, accessible loo and dropped counters. Parking is good as there is a dedicated carpark and this includes blue badge parking spaces. If you are coming under your own steam such as wheeling from a nearby location as  a wheelchair user forget it! If you can negotiate the 6 inch curb you will manage to get in. Once you are in the car park area which is also where the main entrance is situated it gets better. Your challenge is being able to negotiate the lack of dropped curbs to even get this far! Once inside having passed through the automatic doors you will be greeted by security and after a quick check  There are two, clearly signposted, accessible toilets. Not having use them I can't comment further. The staff were helpful, friendly and polite. For a public service building to be inaccessible from the street for wheelchair users is not acceptable. Also when it is providing an essential service which would be very difficult to get elsewhere."

Food is 5 star but pricey In glasgow central station so easy access to trains and easy access from NCP car park attached to station Flat access via coffee shop attached to venue, tight access into lift which was full of food. Also lift is tight had to remove foot plates to fit in. Access in venue is great with wheelchair accessable tables Need to go back up in lift to toilet, tight turning space to enter.

Penilee Community Centre,Penilee Community Centre Access Review. Ramped access available at the front of the building  with two sets of automatic doors.  There is a wide foyer for two wheelchairs to pass easily.  Good size of rooms to use activities. Disabled parking isn't  that great at the  community centre.

Staff are brilliant and really happy to help. 
Ca Va Brasserie,"Ca Va Brasserie New bar and bistro. CA-VA is a new bar bistro in Giffnock on the south side of Glasgow. It's on the site of the old cherry tree, I don't think that place lasted a year I hope this one goes on a bit longer. On streets car parking is very limited, but there is a large car park at Giffnock train station just around the corner. As well as the train there are bus stops going North and South close by. It has level access to enter the premises. The doors are quite heavy and I needed my companion to open them for me, when the staff noticed they came to help.
Although place is fairly small there is a mix of seating inside, high tables, booths and your normal dining tables. The toilet was very clean and roomy. There are a couple of doors before you enter the toilet from the restaurant so you may need a hand. Staff are very pleasant. I had a starter of a haggis scotch egg with peppercorn sauce. I then had macaroni cheese with crab-meat and King prawns both were delicious. The people with me had fish and chips and a minute steak with chips, it looked okay, it was what it was."
Savoy Centre,"Savoy Centre And now for something completely different!. With a incline from street level to get up into the Centre it's certainly something different with an array of market style stalls selling everything you can imagine.  Getting in from street level means going up a sloped entrance. It seemed a bit slippy and could be tricky when it's wet if you're unsteady on your feet. Getting around was OK as a powerchair user although a couple of points were a little narrow but people were great at shifting things and making spa Not sure but didn't see any. People in the Centre were really friendly and helpful. Clearing space, helping to see things on their stalls, and generally welcoming. "
Starbucks,"Starbucks Nice atmosphere, but not accessible. The staff at the particular chain of Starbucks were very friendly, and they always addressed you with your first name wish was nice. However the restaurant was very narrow and quite small which would make it quite difficult for someone in a wheelchair to move aro It is sauchiehall street, so parking is not really an option, is next to traffic lights, meaning one can be dropped off. Very narrow pathways in restaurant but there is an outside sitting area, if one is being accompanied. No disabled toilets. Very very friendly and helpful, also very quick service "
La Vita Spuntini,"La Vita Spuntini Tapas with a twist. Easily accessible from the street (stepfree). A little tight in places in the restaurant. Important to specify you need an accessible seat / space downstairs when booking as they have an upstairs seating area too. Friendly staff and good food. An excellent 5pm.com deal too. Lovel It’s within 5mins walk from central station. There are disabled parking bays on West Nile Street. Lots of on street parking that you can park in with a disabled badge. Stepfree access from the street, very slight incline going into the restaurant.
Slightly tight at points, room for a wheelchair but someone struggle to pass you by. There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor which staff helpfully pointed out. Again if you were in a wheelchair it may be a little snug. They also keep spare high chairs in there. The day I visited it had about 30 helium balloons in it, spares for the tables. So hopefully not a usual occurre When I got up to go to the bathroom a staff member helpfully asked if I knew where it was. Pointed me in the right direction too. Generally the staff were polite and friendly. There is an upstairs seating area so when booking make sure to specify access needs. Some tables have seats against the wall with the other side of the table free standing chairs, but there was plenty of room between tables."
The Art School,"The Art School Accessibility at the Venue for gig. The venue, is really cool, nice bar stocked well with a good selection of beers. Very art school kind of hip.
The gig venue is upstairs, I asked if there was a lift and an accessible toilet.  The staff was very friendly, the lift had been switched off but they go I walked about ten minutes from the bus station, not sure about parking. I know getting the bus there can be a bit awkward Lots of steps, was dark in the venue, the lift was switched on, but there was seats around the venue, if you came early enough Accessible toilet down in basement, unfortunately I never went Friendly and where happy to be asked questions about the venue I would love the venue to be a little bit more accessible"

Ubiquitous Chip,"Ubiquitous Chip No chips at the Chip!. Great food in a great area of Glasgow, but despite the best efforts of the staff it was let down by poor access. There is on street parking on Byres Road which is not far from the venue but this is an extremely busy street. The restaurant is accessed via Ashton lane which is a cobbled street which usually spells trouble for anyone with a mobility impairment (or in high heels!). Between my wife and I we had both so it wasn't an easy trip. The accessible toilet was small and did not have a changing table. Most with a mobility impairment would be able to manage ok. The lighting was also quite poor which might affect anyone with a visual impairment. The biggest issue for me was the toilet is accessed through the bar which is extremely t The staff worked miracles and were so very attentive. The restaurant has so much character, which most of us know comes in the shape of uneven surfaces and strange table layouts. Despite this the staff made it possible for me to get to a table and thoroughly enjoy the meal (albeit with some help fro In reading about the poor access and difficult to reach toilet facilities it may sound like this was an unsuccessful trip. However, the atmosphere, staff support and superb food all resulted in a really enjoyable evening. There may have been a compromise or two to be made in terms of access, but I'l"
The Machair Bar,"The Machair Bar Award winning tacos in this bar. The bar is on two levels with most of the seats (and the loos) up half a dozen steps. Right on Great Western Road. A wee step at the entrance as far as I remember.

Bar is on entry level. Most of the seats and the loos are up half a dozen steps, the steps having rails to hold on to.

Reasonable amount of space between tables. No dedicated accessible loo. Ladies' through reasonably heavy door and then standard cubicles.  Pub quiz on a Sunday!

Food was great - particularly the tacos and the loaded fries. Yum."

There is a car park 0.8 miles from the hotel. There is one road to cross before reaching the hotel. We entered the hotel from inside Central Station. The main entrance had two steps. There were two sets of double doors to allow you to enter the reception. The doors were heavy with no auto door entry. Reception is manned 24 hours daily. There was plenty of seating in the reception area. There were  Toilets available on all floors. Signposts advising where disabled toilets are available.

The Renfield training and conference center is part of the Renfield St Stevens parish church. I have been here on a number of occasions as different poverty groups use it to hold meetings. They have different size meeting rooms to suit your numbers. There is limited on street parking.  Bath Street and Sauchiehall Street have a good bus service from the city center and the West End. Charing Cross train station is within walking distance but it is not accessible for wheelchairs. There is a car park on ElmBank Street. There are no steps to the premises. It is an automatic door to enter. There is an internal lift. As there is plenty of meeting rooms they will find one with space to accommodate you. There is a café with plenty of room. They have an accessible toilet. It's fairly small but manageable. There is always staff on hand if you need help. I was waiting outside on someone and one of the staff can make to ask if I was ok. The café is quite spacious and easy to use.

The Granary,"The Granary Something for everyone. A nice open pub. It has a dining area, a lounge and the front bar. Pub food served by friendly staff. There is different seating throughout the pub so there will be something to suit everyone. They show the football on a large screen in the lounge or TVs throughout.
Front ba Being in Shawlands parking is quite limited. Because it's on the apex of Kilmarnock and Pollockshaws road the bus service is brilliant. Easy to get to from a lot of places in the South side. There are three entrances all of them step free. The only steps within are to the ladies toilet but there is a large accessible toilet. The accessible toilet is quite large so plenty of room to move around . It has one of my pet hates, the toilet flush on the far side out of reach for some.
The lock on the toilet door is also quite high. Very friendly and helpful. Although the entrances are step free you would need somebody to hold the door."

Starbucks,"Starbucks Starbucks for Some. One of many Starbucks in Glasgow. 

Fairly small shop, and narrow, so might not be that easy to move through. Although all on one floor, some of the seating is on a raised level which is only accessible by some steps (about 3 steps, there is a handrail).

All the usual things No parking immediately at it, you may be lucky and get street-parking nearby.
It is in the middle of Glasgow, so could use multi-storey car parks.

Also public transport to area - nearest train station is Queen St, though Glasgow Central not that far away. Buchanan Bus Station is also close, and  The front entrance on West Nile St has steps only. 
You can also enter from the other side, with a door also on Renfield St. This has flat access, the doorway would be fine for most manual chairs, but may be narrow for power wheelchairs. Could also be tricky for some people to open the door. During our visit, the other toilets were out of use, so all customers were using the single accessible toilet. It wasn't that clean, which may be due to it getting used by more people than usual!

The toilet had a radar key lock, but this wasn't getting used. The emergency cord was wrapped round a Staff were friendly even though busy. This is a relatively small Starbucks, and generally may not be the most accessible for everyone to be able to use. There are others very near by, so it's seems there are options!

There are a number of disabled bays in near by queen street. There is a separate entrance  for disabled access and a bell to press to get access. My wife and I were outside pressing the bell for about 10 mins. We called the restaurant which went unanswered. Eventually my wife went up the stairs and asked the to open the door. The staff member then sent me to  Didn't use the toilets. Once in the restaurant we were seated in the centre of the restaurant despite informing them I was a WC user when booking.

Amore Ristorante e Pizzeria,"Amore Ristorante e Pizzeria Nice food, questionable accessibility.The food here is lovely, it really is one of the nicest Italian restaurants in Glasgow, but accessibility leaves a lot to be desired. Tables are packed in, there isn’t a lot of room to move around, the accessible entrance is hidden round the back and the toilets Easily accessible via numerous nearby bus stops on Argyle Street and it’s a very short walk from High Street station. There’s also a drop off point right outside. The disabled access was round the back, hidden away. It would also take you to a table far away from the accessible toilet, which would be hard to navigate to as it’s always busy. There was also no highlights on the stairs into the building, of which there are a considerable amount. I also asked to  The toilet is small and doesn’t seem to have a red cord anywhere. The door into it is a sliding door, but it’s heavy. It also doubles up as baby changing and (I think) a staff locker area. The toilet corridor is accessible via turning a very sharp corner which I imagine would be almost impossible fo The staff were amazingly helpful and helped with anything I needed. But the lack of physical accessibility really is a let down. It should be said that I found the menu available online on their easy to navigate website, which meant - as a visually impaired person - I was able to independently peruse the menu, which is very much appreciated."

So I traveled by public transport , but the nearest place I was to George Square was about half a mile away. The access available was okay if you as mobile in a wheelchair as I am.
There was a lot of cables and the mini ramps covering the cables were quite severe. Most of the portacabin toilets were very good but the small plastic ones were okay if you were in a small manual chair.  If you were using a power chair you would have needed to use one of the portacabin toilets. Most of the volunteers/staff were very helpful. "

Crosshill Railway Station,"Crosshill Railway Station Review of Crosshill Train Station. This is a handy train station as there are regular trains throughout the day that go to Glasgow Central. However, we found that this train station was not accessible for people in wheelchairs as the only entrance to the station is via a set of stairs. 

We got th You are able to park your car on the sidestreets that are near the train station. However, this may involve having to cross a busy road. There are traffic lights but they are located a wee bit down the hill from the entrance to the station. There is only one entrance to the station which there are a number of steps to go down. This would make it inaccessible for wheelchair users. There are no toilets at Crosshill Train Station. The staff are very friendly and helpful when we enquired about tickets. "
The Shenaz - Indian Restaurant,The Shenaz - Indian Restaurant Best Indian restaurant in Glasgow. Great restaurant but not great access. Can get in side door with two steps. Staff will help. I use a wheelchair and get access through fire door with help. A few accessible parking spots at Mitchell theatre across road and some street parking. Not great two steps up to fire door. No accessible toilets. Great staff been going for years. Will always be wiling to assist. It's worth the hard work to get in for the food and great staff.
Bloc+,Bloc+ Poor access. This music venue and food facility has no disabled access and is only accessible by cobble steps at the front of the building. The doorways are too narrow for wheelchair access and there is no disabled toilet. The building also is multi levelled inside with various steps around premises Is on a main bus route but there is a 2 minute walk from bus stop which is uphill so may be difficult for wheelchair users. Very poor only entrance is cobbled steps No disabled toilets Very friendly staff 
William Patrick Library,William Patrick Library Very Poor.Very poor access from the disabled car park to the entrance in a manual wheelchair. I needed assistance from a kind gentleman to push me up the hill. Astonishingly I discovered that the community hub was closed from 9am to 1pm and even then by appointment only. All correspondence in letter     
Buzz Bingo Possilpark,"Buzz Bingo Possilpark Failing Disabled Patrons. Disabled bays getting abused... FROM THE FRONT DOOR... power doors don't open automatically from the outside until you put hard physical pressure on them. WALKING INTO THE HALL... first Disabled Toilet, RADAR lock removed and RED CORD tied up to shaky hand rail...

The Esquire House,"The Esquire House The Esquire House. Good access straight from the car park. No dsignated disabled parking to sight, plenty or room in the car park however.

Apex City of Glasgow Hotel ,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel  Review on apex hotel bath st. There are steps up to the entrance. No visual wheelchair access.

Castleton Primary School,Castleton Primary School Emergency cord tied up.

Clintons,"Clintons Access Review, Clintons, Braehead. Shop design is poor with a limited amount of space around the shop and narrow aisles. Parking is reasonable at Braehead with a number of disabled parking on the upper and lower level. Getting into the shop is okay but it is difficult to  manoeuvre around the shop. Clintons don't have any accessible toilets. There are only accessible toilets in the middle of the centre. Staff are good and friendly. "
